are we gonna is this we're gonna do this

soon

oh yeah okay wait for okay cool

[Music]

and back across the side of the screen

I'm crawling off the side of it

but don't do that okay

um

what don't look right at it okay

greetings programs AIDS oh buddy Ingrid

Bernal here hanker and Ferndale coming

back to you from Rune Hammer this is

drunkens and Dragons everything you're

seeing here this entire all this

Splendor is the workshop of my little

obsession

at this point are we even really playing

old school Essentials I mean we've

changed to my hit system which

fundamentally Alters the core of combat

we really don't even have our books at

the table anymore we don't use XP we use

Milestone leveling and even then if

somebody gets like a new spell or

something we're Outsourcing our spell

lists to the old a D and D complete

handbook Series so are we even really

playing old school Essentials are we

even playing D and D not really we do

roll under on all our stats we have a

lot of player facing combat that goes on

we only have three saves armor magic and

death

and all the monsters I basically create

from scratch

based on inherited Knowledge from three

decades of playing so are we really

playing old school Essentials not really

but I guess it's a it's a way to tag

which game I'm talking about this is my

osc game I'm in three weekly games right

now so it's something useful I guess I

could just call it dirty jobs season two

so this is Dirty Jobs season two uh

session three now I got my um I got my

handy dandy Journal here keep that handy

in case I'm halfway through this video

and I just completely lose my mind and

have no idea what I'm talking about or

how to remember a session which anybody

who's in multiple games knows even two

three days later it can be hard to

remember the details of what happens but

not this time because we have a huge

session on our hands now also I'm gonna

pepper some video uh some photos here uh

here and there into the video but we

both my table games have returned to

full 3d terrain we've got painted

Miniatures we've got styrofoam as far as

the eye can see so this session the

third session of session two with the

Dirty Jobs went back to using full

terrain full painted Miniatures still I

mean everybody's going to use an index

card with a sharpie scrolling on it now

and again it's kind of inevitable but

it's so fun to get back into that so you

can look at the photos that I'm going to

throw in here and then also keep that in

your mind's eye that these are really

visual sessions and they're kind of part

of the the fun of what happened but

let's get to it now as you know my

players were down in the town of

slimshire which is a town that they

basically created in the first season

the first campaign with this same group

of players they reached an epic level

they founded a town and indeed a

religion

and this is 25 years later by various

events which you guys can catch up in

the other Recaps they are now heading

north to Fairfield Abbey a mysterious uh

Monastery Abbey in the foothills of the

Iron Hills which is to the north east of

slim Shire in the sort of our version of

Dave arneson's Blackmore at this point

it's changed so much I couldn't even

call it Blackmore anymore we call it the

North holds they're heading north and uh

under these rumors that these nuns and

monks up at this Abbey are working on or

have achieved a cure for vampirism as

they leave town they realize that the

the mayor's daughter now the mayor is

one of their former characters so they

really give a [ __ ] about this mayor one

of his two daughters has been infected

with vampirism and is indeed out in the

Moonlight you know is seen on the the

ramparts of the far wall of the town and

they know that they have to go do this

they have to find a cure for her

so they set out north but since this

rumor has spread that these uh nuns are

working on this cure they have not been

heard from okay so that is the opener

for session three my players head out

north along the road we have a lot of

discussion and role play talking about

recapping events different things like

this

and they bump into a ruined Way Station

which is sort of like a chapel now in

some states I haven't really seen it out

here in the East but in the west of the

U.S along some highways there are these

very small chapels and they're like a

teeny little miniature church and and a

lot of times they're sort of not very uh

up kept and I'm not really entirely sure

why they're there or what people do with

them but they do exist and my players

come upon one of these along this road

it's this small sort of Stone Road

church but extremely small I mean like

you know one little pillar with one

Little Rock above it and one little sort

of marker Stone but it's been vandalized

it's been mostly destroyed and looking

over this vandalized Waypoint or this

little chapel is a dwarf named arazam

now in our world the dwarves of the Iron

Hills all have like Z's and M's in their

name so you'll get used to it over time

they come up to Arizona and they have

this whole role-playing sort of

encounter talking to him about his anger

that these these markers have been

destroyed by Orcs and my players all

kind of light up at that moment we have

never had a single Orc in any game of

ours so for the first time they are

gonna encounter Orcs And of course he's

a badass dwarf he's been sent out on a

scouting Mission his job is to look for

these Orcs And just like so many uh

other Dwarven stories

I am running our sort of Dwarven

environment or storyline in our world

off of duero deep you can see it right

there it's that big yellow spine book on

my shelf that's by Greg Gillespie it's

his new Dwarven Mega dungeon and like as

I was mentioning so many of these

stories the dwarves have been kicked out

of their own home

the Orcs have been occupying gungathal

which is this Mega dungeon under the

mountain and dwarves have been ousted

from their own home for 30 years but now

the Rune casters have thrown their

prophecies and it's time to retake the

mountain so they've sent out a bunch of

Scouts to go find the Orcs And track

them into what entrance they're using or

how they're moving in and out of the

mountain because as you guys know with

Dwarven stonecraft it's often very hard

to find the front gate or any door or

entrance to a mountain even for the

dwarves when the Orcs are now in control

from within so they probably changed

where the doors are they barricaded some

and they're using others and the dwarves

need to basically learn their movements

so that they can exploit those movements

and begin to devise a military strategy

to retake gungathal all of this is

exchanged with my players with their

role-playing session with erazam along

the highway at this wrecked Chapel

so we get through all that Arizon is

they they really befriend him and

they're really cool to him they kind of

exchange like a real kind of like oh

yeah my brother and he's like I have to

keep going west I know there's this

Caravan going to Cloud top they also

have a goblin infestation the Orcs are

probably there too this is all connected

I'm gonna go but you guys good luck on

your journey to the Abbey I went by

there and they were really rude the

whole place was shut it up so I don't

know what they're doing they used to be

really hospitable good luck okay so

that's the opener my players say right

on let's cruise on up the road they go a

little ways further up the road and

where there used to be like an old

tolling Tower so like a very small

Castle right like maybe a 15 foot tall

little single Tower with one room in the

bottom basically used in some long

bygotten time long bygone time to charge

users of the highway a toll or to guard

a border that no longer exists it's now

crumbled and it's sort of littered

across the highway so remember too I've

mentioned this in previous Recaps our

world is in a state of political decline

so the borders and the roads are no

longer maintained so you have all this

Rubble that's been spread into the road

now anybody who's played D for any

length of time knows that if a road is

cluttered or somewhat blocked up ahead

is not a good sign it usually means an

ambush my players have not been playing

d d very much so they're just like oh

there's some rocks in the road they

start cruising up sure enough there's an

orc poking around they kind of try to

sneak up on them but they kind of don't

and uh Ravel are one of our very Bold

characters just comes out and says you

there scum

just like wow okay so it is a larger

Force than just a single orc it is three

spearmen and two of these nasty orc bear

Riders isn't even gonna will it folk

whoa look at that Focus two of those

they're moving around in the trees

around the road they're going to attack

they've been openly called out and we

have our first combat encounter now this

combat encounter was super cool really

really proud of it and it went really

well I have orc spearmen who are just

basic melee Fighters and then I have

these bear writers who are super fast

tough and also have a uh greased arrows

is what I call it so they they actually

sort of put a slight sheen of like like

Pig lard like butter fat on the shafts

of their arrows and it lets them like

rip up to four of them off in a shot and

they're also crack shots they're

Bullseye shots they don't miss so what

this means is that when one of these orc

bear Riders fires they fire one D4

arrows and those four those one 1d4

arrows hit 1d4 targets and those people

have to roll armor so these guys don't

roll it to hit roll they just go bang

bang they just don't miss

it's up to you to brace with your

pauldron or to lean your helmet down

into your armor to take the arrow and

let it bounce off so at first my players

are a little bit like holy [ __ ] wait he

didn't roll an attack roll and I'm like

yeah he's too good but once they

accepted it that really made the tactics

change and sometimes you do have to be a

little bit extreme you know to to get

that fear in a player where they won't

just

brazenly go up and just stab everything

and just win sometimes you know enemy

abilities need that extremity to drive

them to cover so that the battle went

from kind of like this scattered out so

that everybody could get cover and then

the real sort of down and dirty fighting

began so as usual our Druid has no real

means of direct attack he begins doing

things to control the battlefield And

Delay the enemy that's really his whole

character build is using entanglement

using birds and stuff basically to just

get a delay of around here and there on

an enemy now that may sound kind of

passive or you know like a really pure

support role and it is but hot damn is

it powerful when you have the other

players working in conjunction with

those delays and focusing fire on

non-delayed enemies right the delayed

enemies can be left alone it is highly

effective And So It Begins we get some

great roles in here and we're also we've

agreed that we're kind of inventing our

classes and if I hear a compelling rule

modification that we we want to make

part of a class and then you can execute

it it's part of your class so we did

have that we have a new called shot for

beheading if using a great sword

um we do have use a new rule involving

bracing uh when drinking an entire skin

of beer which allows you to ignore one

subsequent attack with a conroll

you know it's that feeling of being

invulnerable after a liter of beer you

know so all these little things we're

kind of inventing as we move along and

it's funny because my players said a

wonderful thing it's like oh yeah we're

game designers it's fine this feeling of

agency not only in the story of the game

but in its structure and its function to

me is super freaking dope it's wonderful

to see players feel such Freedom not to

just invent and do anything that's not

the point the point is that there are

limits but that we have to agree and

negotiate on what rules we're going to

sort of embrace and it's up to them also

to keep notes on these rules I'm not

keeping some kind of central thing at

least yet I think in time it's going to

get so cool we might just have to like

not call it ose anymore

and publish it I think that might have

to happen because it's just growing with

such an organic uh Vibe so anyways we

get some some beheading that occurs in a

a really pitched battle between our

character cap and one of these orc

spearmen we get some jumping off of

rocks that's occurring then we get some

these uh these real like Fast Dash type

movements from these orc bear Riders

they basically like Zip kind of like

Mega Man style across the map and then

from a new vantage point

why would I do this this seems kind of

mean right but what it does is it keeps

players scrambling for cover and when

players are scrambling for cover battles

don't get boring and so on it goes we

get down to the last guy and this was

hilarious the last guy these Orcs are

not stupid he needs to go report to his

command that he has encountered

resistance and that more Orcs need to

come and Hunt these characters down

because they were able to kill almost an

entire Patrol he needs to escape so

before the battle's really over he sees

this my orc he like basically drops his

gear he's had his bear put to sleep so

he jumps off his Mount and he just

starts running off into the woods my

players realize if this guy is escapes

they've got like a military problem on

their hand so they all drop what they're

doing they finish they do a mop up and

finish killing the other Orcs they're

running this guy down and then we went

into this hilarious like rugby situation

I swear this went on for a solid hour

they're chasing this guy through the

woods unable to kill him and only really

succeeding on slight efforts to slow him

down so he keeps my he's like dragging

one of them on a rope he's entangled for

a second but then they all miss their

attack rolls then he's like pulling

through then he turns around and whacks

somebody upside the head they're down

they need to be brought up they're going

through we got got one guy on one hit

who's getting scared so he's backing

away from the battle and this guy just

keeps going the Invincible rugby guy

going for the end zone

and it just got funnier and funnier and

funnier as their dice got worse and

worse worse and mine were just on

straight on fire and it's just hilarious

finally we managed to get this sucker

down like we really need a bathroom

break and a food break at this point we

finally get this guy down we get our

five minute break okay so on up the road

we're now halfway through the session

on up the road we have a vastly

different encounter so I have to clear

off my entire table of like Forest

assets flip my mat over to its like gray

Stony side and get out all my stones and

ruins and build the front of this

Monastery up they come up this hill into

the fog it's this creepy you know sort

of a name of the Rose kind of building

you know it's got like tall Gothic

architecture with this giant wooden door

and this mist is blowing over and this

thing is built up on like a Crag like in

the sort of the Highlands right

intentionally to create isolation for

these sort of holy uh you know

scriveners right scriveners I think is

the real word but I prefer to say

scribners

I'm at that level

so they go up up into the mist and right

away they know something's wrong the

windows are boarded over and they're

screaming and they come up over and they

come up into a cemetery and this huge

wall this front entrance of the

monastery and coming around the corner

right as they show up remember they are

totally bedraggled they're on very low

amounts of hits and resources right now

they come right up and there's no time

for anything coming around the corner

the far corner of the building at the

edge of this really Steep Hill a fell

they were calling it

there's a sort of um a worker she's not

one of the the holy nuns like in a habit

but uh you know a sister of the

monastery who does like architectural

work and garden work right she's like

Apparently one of the last survivors and

she comes around this corner and this

huge Specter of a nun like this big

flowing white cloth Specter is going

with a skull's head is coming around and

basically reaching out with these Stony

fingers about to draw the life out of

this last survivor and behind her this

trail of blood and muck behind this

spectral ghost figure so much so we want

we nicknamed her the blood mop and she

slid around like leaving blood behind

her and lifting up out of the ground she

has these skeletal servants who are at

her side she reaches out at the opening

of the combat which is not even allowed

for initiative we don't even really have

that much narrative on who or what or

why it's just bang it's right here she

reaches out to this worker the you know

this sort of Garden or handyman type nun

reaches out and you want to talk about

an extreme ability I decided to cook the

entire ability of like a wraith-like

monster down into a yes no question does

the wraith with this touch drain the

life out of its Target meaning drop you

to zero hits It's that simple it's a yes

no does it happen bang I get a no okay

so the worker none stumbles away she's

not just instantly killed at the opening

of the combat maybe we have something

interesting on our hands but my players

are pale they're stricken with fear

they're not like jumping forward like

let's battle this thing they're just

like but we need info so they break into

like this research team thing it was so

weird so they're trying to look at the

cemetery and read the graves they're

trying to examine the front door they're

trying to understand the architecture

maybe there's another entrance somewhere

they're trying to find out where

everyone is what happened and on this

goes for like three excruciatingly long

rounds of me rolling does the Specter

drain the life from the handyman a handy

woman and the answer is no

so they're basically avoiding gaining

the attention of this evil skeleton

Entourage in this huge like vengeful

Specter who's like 12 feet tall

you know doing all that stuff

craziness

but I just keep getting no on the die so

they're they're they're holding they're

investigating the door they're

investigating the graves finally

somebody's just getting fed up and is

like let's go inside maybe we have a

better defensive position let's just go

in they finally pull open this huge

wooden door

and I have it in there somewhere it

doesn't matter it just doesn't matter

they finally pull open this huge wooden

door and inside instead of the entryway

of a monastery or a nunnery instead of a

stone hallway with tapestries and

curtains and a rug instead of a rumpus

room with coats hanging on on hooks and

or a foyer with a set of boots on one

side

none of that

it's a complete void

the inside of this door is just a

lightless

featureless nothing and even looking to

the sides of the door there's no

interior wall it is a door hovering in

the middle of an endless nothingness

and like a few leaves like blow in there

on the breeze and a little bit of mist

and they just descend down and disappear

into the dark

already kind of pale with fear when they

saw this Specter and they knew this was

possibly going to be an enemy they don't

have any magic weapons they're they just

started they're all level two

they have they know they have no way of

hurting this they have no offensive

magic all they have is Druid magic and

they're just like now they open that

there's this void and they just it was

so great to just see the color drain out

of the fit like now what do they do they

can't go hide inside they've got this

thing they pretty much know they can't

defeat

they realize that this is a battle of

information they have to use knowledge

to their benefits somehow

right and so finally we we kind of back

away from this void even though it has a

weird effect on them I must say it's

like they're drawn to it in a weird way

like they they want to go find out

what's in there even though I told them

it's just an absolute infinite

nothingness

so finally they're like this is a this

is a battle of knowledge but it's kind

of getting too late the Specter and her

Entourage of risen dead are are noticing

them and getting close so cap who's

really is our tank basically jumps

forward and engages

these skeletons and the Specter is still

trying to draw the life out of the handy

woman so he avoids that dice roll for

the moment but I still get a no

all of the skeleton the Risen guard and

I as I call them attack cap and fail he

takes all four of these attacks doesn't

even notice he's he's doing the thing

he's got all of the enemies occupied

this is what tanks do best not

necessarily the killing but the keeping

them occupied and then we finally get a

breakthrough on these intelligence

translation and wisdom roles on these

Graves they realize that the graves have

portraits that perfectly resemble each

of the guards these risen skeletons and

then one of the graves belongs to Sister

Agatha and she is portrayed on her

tombstone with this big white flowing

nuns habit and this is a spectral giant

version of her they realize these

Spirits have been lifted from their

tombs by something they ask the handy

woman they finally pull her out of this

mesmeric state she's been in with the

Specter what is going on and she says we

we delved Too Deep the magic was too

strong we lost control they've risen and

then of course my players say we've got

to put her at rest again we're not going

to destroy these things we need to put

them at rest

and so the handy woman says yes that

stands to reason how do we do it so they

begin reading these gravestones which

are basically like written in Latin

they need time just to read these you

know these spiritual sanctity type stuff

but there's a lot of words it's like

sort of doing a reverse exorcism put you

back in your grave they okay we have a

solution to the situation but I'll tell

you it's not easy you still got to make

roles this thing is still moving around

and completely deadly this whole feeling

the music was really building up

and for reasons that I don't I'm not

sure any of us will ever understand our

player Kilroy who's who's has a a name

that would throw you off what his

character really is his character really

is a hobo a monk uh and sort of a seeker

of holy knowledge

and something snaps in his brain

something just it's crazy

he looks in this door with these leaves

drifting into this void and I like she

went wild hide he runs across the map

and just Swan dives into the void

now I think part of this was a player

just having no idea what to do next and

so finding something to do

I think part of this was a form of meta

gaming faith

that there would be something in there

and he goes

he just base jumps into the void

just disappears in the dark

and we just describe he's just falling

so long he wants his stomach kind of

settles with it he doesn't even feel

like he's falling because there's no

frame of reference

he's just

there's just a slight breeze you know

there's a wind and he's just

so I make him wait and I tell him you're

going to fall for D4 rounds and I think

we get like a three so he's gonna be

falling forever that is quite a long

time to fall while the other players are

all playing this is five players at the

table by the way three rounds is no

small amount of time

so he's just falling into the void

d right this shit's crazy so these guys

go on with the translation they manage

to finally finish this recitation of

this ancient incantation of rest

and sister Agatha and her risen guards

are all finally slowly they're

reabsorbed into their graves and silence

returns to this Bluff but sister Marta

the handy woman she has survived and now

owes the heroes her life and and indeed

the wellness of the monastery remember

she's not like one of the Holy magicians

she's the handy woman

the rest have all been and she kind of

goes ahead and tells my players now the

rest of all either exploded were

murdered had their life drained out of

them or fell into the void as it

encapsulated the entire interior of the

monastery but as these Spirits are

finally put to rest they look again to

go check on Kilroy to see if he's still

just falling if they can even see him

down there maybe he has a light of some

kind

but the void then fills in with bricks

and all the Timbers return and this dark

magic that opened this void is canceled

and the interior of the monastery is now

visible where the void once was

finally we come back to Kilroy and he

sees the top of a stone ziggurat

appeared down in the nothingness and now

he realizes and remembers I'm falling at

insane speed as this thing comes ripping

up to him we roll a yes no do you splat

or do you somehow land because of a pool

of water or magic or a slowing effect of

some kind this is a character's life on

a single yes no roll right here Bang

he survived somehow he lands in this

pool of water crawls out and looks

around

this is basically the end of session

three

crazy but I do give my players a little

epilogue that is between us and a lot of

times I have faith in the difference

between player knowledge and character

knowledge and I'll just go ahead and

give players more knowledge than their

characters could ever conceivably have

just for fun because I think it just

builds the The Knowing of the game

so I'm like okay

so you guys when we set out on this I

discussed wanting to do all the things

or a lot of things we had never done in

the first season two of them is

large-scale dungeons that I consider

real Classics and tasty dungeons one of

them that I chose is the Temple of

Elemental Evil

this void is one of the access points to

the Temple of Elemental Evil so Kilroy

is somewhere down in there we'll

probably not survive alone and injured

for long in the center of the Temple of

Elemental Evil but I'm just saying

that's going to be part of our world

also the other one is gungathal which

comes from duero Deep the book by Greg

Gillespie that is the undermountain that

the dwarves speak of and so just so you

know these are kind of two of the

large-scale choices that you're going to

be facing

so we finished this up and they're like

oh wow that sounds really cool it's kind

of a um what should we get into that's

interesting well dwarves are always cool

but I feel like the Temple of Elemental

Evil probably has more to do with the

bigger storyline well yeah blah blah

blah and that wait a minute wait a

minute

what about the damn cure

what about the cure for vampirism the

reason we all came up here and almost

died

like half of us are on one hit now like

we have no real way to heal like

what about the Cure

sister Marta reaches into her overalls

and presents what I describe basically

as looking like The Holy Hand Grenade of

Antioch it's like a golden ball she

cracks it open and as she opens it I say

wait

since you asked the question

in all their efforts using this volatile

magic and opening this void and and

Rising me raising these spirits on

accident and all this terribleness that

happened to get this cure how many doses

of the Cure were they able to create

before it all went wrong roll a D4 for

me now a four here would be huge

huge remember this is a world afflicted

by the arch vampire lord that was

created by my characters that was one of

my characters in the previous season of

the game so vampirism is a core and

spreading problem of this world

crack the orb opens the D4 is rolled

of course you all know what was rolled

there are no more hero coins on this

table they've been completely expended

there's no redoing this role It's All or

Nothing

and it comes up a one

one dose to cure vampirism after all of

this struggle

now they face a terrible choice that was

session three my dudes and my dudets

thanks for tuning in to Rune Hammer you

guys uh look down in the description for

useful things who knows what uh yeah I

publish things sure I hang out on

Instagram you know I I draw stuff with

sharpies I'll see you guys on the

internet strength honor and beer

remember if you keep it real and you

don't steal you always gonna get a deal

all right tune in next time

and what what's coming next oh yeah

we're going to be recapping hard suit

session eight it's been a fun week of

gaming have a good weekend you guys and

I'll see you on that old internet all

right peace

[Music]

foreign

[Music]


[Music]

thank you

this is Rune hammer

no no no no no no no no no

greetings programs my name is brandish

gilhelm and this is Rune Hammer welcome

back and thanks for tuning in as always

it's great to have you

today we are going to be talking about

the s word I am not talking about

silliness I am talking about

spells

yes spells they make you crazy don't get

mad get even there are so many spells so

many details then the slot stuff and do

I need spell cards is it still the

Wizard's turn how does the Swarm thing

work anyway

spells are one of the biggest clumsiest

and uh often most cumbersome parts of

any RPG that's right take a look at your

own game and uh you probably notice that

spells are eating your brain and eating

your table time so let's take a minute

sit together do some deep thinking and

let's solve this spell problem once and

for all

oh

all right if we're gonna solve the spell

problem we want to make the Wizard

player happy we want to keep the dungeon

master sane and we want the evil Casters

in your game to also be Lively exciting

and and easy and effective for you to

play as the dungeon master but that

first one we've got to remember a player

who is a sorcerer or a wizard or a druid

or a paladin or any magic user needs to

be satisfied and having a great time

with the spell system so we have to make

sure that we nail that part of the

solution okay so I'm going to propose

three steps for you to do in your game

to get your spell system back under your

control to harness it in and to make it

a tool that you use to make your

campaign in your game World cooler

rather than being used by it which I

don't know if you guys are like me but

that happens to me a lot I am Victor

minimized by the spell list especially

in DND now 5e is a little bit lighter

than some of the um the the games in the

past with DND like when spell compendium

came into play there's just so many

spells and you just can't remember them

now that's okay you can use the book at

the table but we all know what happens

when books start getting cracked open at

the table time starts ticking away and

other players waiting for a wizard to do

his turn or for you as the dungeon

master to do an evil Caster's turn they

will start checking their phones they

want to go get some macaroni and cheese

and go outside and then before you know

it someone's lost in the bushes and your

night's over

we don't want that to happen we want to

solve this problem and make spells fast

and intuitive but we want to keep that

mystical magical feeling of sort of

a collection of Arcane Mysteries you

know each spell it is okay if each spell

feels like a little mystery right that

that is part of the Allure of using

magic in a game is that the Spells are a

bit Arcane complex and odd and so a

fighter is always rolling his eyes right

and he isn't just rolling his eyes at

the wizard like the character he's

rolling his eyes at the player who's a

wizard and that Dynamic is really no pun

intended magical

[Music]

we're going to do this in three steps

first

I want you to take ownership of your

spell list second I want you to hack

down the spell rules into what I call

tears and third uh I want you to embrace

what I call formless Magic now in these

three steps I think you're going to find

yourself in a new and Rich

area

in your game where spells are going to

play a vibrant role

the first step taking ownership of your

spell list okay what does this really

mean well you guys have tons of RPG

books right I mean let's face it you

collect them

a lot of times you get a big RPG book

there's a really cool section on

creating characters there's a little bit

of world story going to get those

characters some flavor right and then

you you just go sort of stumbling into

this massive spell list which is like

half or more of the book and you guys

all know how this goes and have felt

this feeling now if you're a magic user

maybe you're really excited by that but

me as an RPG collector I often get a

little harumpy when a ton of a book is

spent on spells and for example let's

say I don't get any monsters or I don't

get any good encounters or I don't get

any good maps

those things I want more than a million

spells now I totally want a few dozen

spells absolutely I mean come on this is

an RPG right but I don't need 50 or more

I don't need 100 I don't need 200. okay

so what I mean by taking ownership of

your spell list means to make it your

own now you're gonna have to do this at

the beginning of a campaign you're not

going to be able to Spring a magic

overhaul on a group who is like eighth

level or something who's been playing

together for years it's not going to

work they've been memorizing that game

and that spell list and let them be

that's awesome but if you're starting a

new game here's your chance to own your

spell list okay so now there's a few

rules that you can go by as you try to

assemble a spell list for your world I

mean you're just going to sit down with

a notebook and say here are the Spells

first of all if a spell doesn't add

flavor to your world to your campaign

bag it

yes

it's intense right the first

ramification of this rule for owning

your spell list might be there's no such

thing as magic Missile

or burning hands like those spells even

though they're classic Staples don't

really add anything to the flavor of a

particular Campaign World so I would say

bagum if you need a low-level damage

spell which is all that you know a

zillion spells just fall into this group

they just have style right magic Missile

cone of cold and all these kinds of

things just super simple little blasties

you know this is there I got you so

you're still going to need a low level

simple damage spell right I mean we

gotta have that then you don't want to

leave your Mage so high and dry you

can't even do that but you're not going

to have magic Missile you're going to

have you know feathers of the Raven or

you know the the flying quills or

something if those are both animal

themed I don't know why but they're I'm

starting to already stumble into

something maybe magic in my world is

animalistic or nature themed okay so

that's the first rule if it doesn't add

flavor to your campaign to your world

bag it

and if you really need the spell

functionally speaking well then put it

in a nice wrapper that fits

second smaller is better as far as your

list goes and just hand out some of the

little stuff okay what do I mean here

well obviously the shorter the spell

list the more command of it you're going

to be able to have the more

effectively and with excitement be able

to Dole those spells out over time have

them be found have them be learned from

a mentor or have them be inscribed on a

doorway and so on and so forth if

there's two dozen spells in your entire

Campaign World each one becomes way more

exciting it's a much bigger Discovery

and a bigger progression jump

now that leads right into my third Point

here on taking ownership of your spell

list which is to divvy your spells up

into a progression so as you're coming

up with these cool names of these spells

you know like Alfonso's abhorrent

aberration right

wow that sounds that could be low level

like you kind of just conjure some

little blobs with teeth or it could be

high level like you make this giant sort

of mutant creature or maybe you turn

yourself into sort of some kind of

horrible mutant creature that can fight

for a small amount of time

either way design the power into the

spell

instead of this spell can kind of be

this powerful if cast this way or kind

of be the event you're just creating

variability and muddying the water of

how awesome a spell is a great way to

really drive this technique home is to

choose your Supreme spell

okay now whatever theme you think is fun

or especially whatever theme your Wizard

player thinks is really fun or is really

powerful you know maybe it's like a

dimension Gateway or something maybe

it's a teleportation is the the highest

level in your minds then you give it a

big dramatic name and you place it way

there up at the the apex of the spell

list and it is known across the land

that that is the most powerful spell

the Angelic Conjuring or whatever and

magicians talk about this stuff there's

a legend about it no one has ever

mastered it there's one guy who cast it

once but he was killed in the process

and so on and so forth the the

progression of the Spells is discreet it

is in your face it's out in the open and

it gives that wizard something to Chase

rather than a list that's so muddy in

its power levels that he's kind of like

well am I going to take this or am I

going to take that I'm not sure maybe

I'll get the you don't want that you

want this Chase feeling

now finally something that I've been

alluding to throughout taking ownership

of your spell list is to work with your

Wizard player or players

so whoever is using magic in your game

as a player needs to be the most

invested then later you can take the

spells that you developed with the

players for your bad guys and you know

you can adapt you're the GM you can do

whatever right but those players need to

be invested one time I had a a wizard

character in fourth edition

um named Ivan and Ivan his his power was

all held in this sword called the blood

iron blade and all of my my spells I

wanted to be themed around this sword

and like the sword could catch fire it

could kind of like turn into a rope he

could turn into a snake or like it could

get very small so I could hide it it

could get really big so that it could

almost be like a Siege weapon and all

these different sort of things and I

wanted this sword to be the focus of my

magic

I didn't really we didn't have those

spells available to us and for that

particular game we weren't doing a lot

of hacking or or Custom Creation and so

that Wizard never really became what I

wanted him to be he kind of wound up

doing Fireball right

just with it focused on the sword

um but here's I think the biggest part

this spell list needs to be a spell list

that your Wizard player looks at and

just drools just dying to get her hands

on these spells

okay so now there you go you have a

spell list that you can lean back and

say oh man this is gonna be awesome

now I have a few references for my talk

uh here today about spells and when it

comes to spell lists as I was doing my

research uh over the last few weeks uh I

have to say that Burning Wheel and Simba

room probably have to me the most

intriguing Compact and uh digestible

spell lists Simba room especially the

Spells are directly tied to the lore of

the world in a way that is just

undeniably cool now on The Burning Wheel

side the Spells have that well you guys

know how Burning Wheel it is it has that

extremely unique uh textural feel to it

um that is a bit hard to understand but

is Compact and has tons of sort of

subtext built in there's no magic

Missile

it's it's much more flavorful than that

so check those two spell lists out if

you get a chance I think you'll really

like it okay

so now we've got two more methods to go

to get your spells in shape in your game

okay once you've got this spell list and

you know maybe it's just names and a few

ideas for what the mechanics could be

right work on all the details later

we're just trying to do the Creative

heavy lifting

you've got your spell list you know

these names are cool fits your world

your player is excited about it you're

ready okay now step two hacking down

your rules into discrete tiers hack to

tears man

[Music]

okay with tears I don't mean like you

know the tears of Gabriel I mean tears

as in TI are

t-i-t-s-t-r-i-t-s-e-r no

t-i-e-r-s right tears these are like

very distinct levels of statistical

relevance is a way to say it Okay so

how do you do this the biggest way that

you get your stats to boil down into

tears is to glob them into

clumps that are easy to write okay so

instead of something one spell being 10

feet and the other spell being 25 feet

and another spell being 18 feet as far

as you know maybe it's range or

something right

you can make yourself tears for spell

ranges it could be short and long

short is sort of 30 feet and Below long

is 30 feet and above right and that way

all of the spells that you're going to

be writing down or maybe you're

describing the spells in your new spell

list they're either short or long range

this is so much easier to write remember

and play than actual measurements

all right so spell range is either

short or long is a great example okay

another one could be duration is either

short or long short is sort of one round

long is three now I know this is going

to take some of the detail out of your

spells but that's what you want you want

variety but you don't want so much

detail that you need like 20 little

cards at your table you want to be able

to write a Spell's description in one

line so it can fit on a character sheet

or on your notes as a as a DM

another way to glob stats down into

tears is maybe even to give it a number

system right so maybe there's a tier one

tier two and tier three spell okay

everything of tier one has a short range

and a short duration and can only be

cast instantly and so on and once per

day a tier 2 spell can be test twice per

day or once per encounter

has a long range and short duration and

then a tier 3 has long range long

duration and can be cast you know twice

or an infinite number of times with a

roll or something to that effect right

so tier one two three is all you would

really need to write down in your notes

and then somewhere else you have a

little cheat card that says what those

tiers mean so do you see what the goal

is is you're trying to take all this

specificity all this variability and in

a lot of cases all this arbitrariness

and boil it down into terms you can

easily use and memorize and sling at the

table okay so that's that's really

um number two

hack down your rules into tears

you don't need every spell to have its

own set of rules you can have common

wordage that describes how spells work

and will make them easy to execute at

the table and it can go all the way from

damage to how often you can cast AOE

range touch or line of sight all this

kind of stuff it can all be boiled down

into tears give it a try on a couple of

spells and you'll see exactly what I

mean and you'll never go back it's a

really great way

clean things up

okay so the third point of how we are

going to make magic

cooler more exciting and more hours

in our game is to embrace what I call

formless Magic

[Music]

originally in my fifth edition game

um last year formless magic was

introduced as a sort of found artifact

there's this book that uh contained this

method the method was that if you could

describe a thing and had the will to

enact it you could create any effect

imaginable that's right any effect

describable or imaginable could be

accomplished but there was a 2d6 dungeon

World style role associated with it with

a variable level of success and sort of

Mercurial or cruel or volatile failure

so sure I can turn that Dragon into a

pollywog but I need to roll the 2d6 to

see exactly a if I do it

which is roll a 7 or higher

and B how much the cost really winds up

being and did I barely succeed is it not

going to last uh did it take a piece out

of me did I actually fail to cast the

spell did I fail so bad that I opened a

portal to hell

this uh

form of magic in my campaign actually

became much more focal and Central than

I anticipated and in my mind there's

really no going back from it

now there are different games that

capture this idea in different levels of

Effectiveness but what I would recommend

to you is to let the entire rest of what

spells are going to be in your world

beyond your list right because maybe

your list only has 15 spells or a dozen

spells

everything else that's going to happen

is now in the sort of the the mind and

the imagination of your Wizard player

your Wizard's gonna your player is going

to be like hey there's not a spell to

light a sword on fire can I as an

advanced wizard can I write that spell

can I create that spell I want to call

it the burning blade

and you as the dungeon master sure as

hell ought to say yes remember that's

your your Credo is you say yes then or

yes if not no

and so having a little bit of

preparation around how to use formless

magic will go a long way for you and I

got a couple of tips there on how to be

ready first of all think about employing

a role I know a lot of magic in a lot of

games doesn't use roles but if you let

this formless thing kind of go wild

the dice can control the level of power

and you don't have to worry about it

becoming this sort of world destroying

power because the dice will always be

more cruel than you anticipate

secondly consider a system of micro

currency

micro currency is a tool that is used to

tremendous effect in Dungeon world and

even more so in um a sundered world I

think is it called a sundered world yeah

the the dungeon World supplement which

the classes have all these different

types of micro currency what the hell is

micro currency you ask well it's kind of

an abstract little currency in the case

of magic we could call it Mana or animus

right you have six animus

you can you know devise the the burning

blade spell that we described earlier

but it's each time you cast it it's

going to cost you three animus

you recover one animus per day of of

living and you can only ever have a six

maximum so you see what I mean the

player winds up deciding how to use this

disposable micro currency which in DCC

also takes the form of hit points or you

could even have it take the form of

intelligent stat points that are burned

to create formless effect

either way a micro currency system does

the same function as adding a dice roll

to a formless spell

keeps it from becoming this world

Destroyer keeps it in check while not

keeping what the spell is in check so

consider those techniques

and think about the beauty of formless

magic

so to devise this talk today about

spells I did some extensive homework

here in the laboratory and online and I

just wanted to mention to you guys the

references that really stood out to me

in that quest for how to really boil

this concept down as far as I could and

make it a digestible 30 minute talk

I just have a short list of books here

and uh I'm sure a lot of you already

have these and I would invite you to

kind of go back and give these a

detailed look as far as their magic

systems if like me you're chafing a

little bit at how spells and spell

listings can feel in your RPG the first

one is as I mentioned Simba room this is

a brilliant little RPG book and has an

interesting quarter mechanic of

expansively detailed world

but to me most of all I just think their

spell list absolutely shown it just

jumped off the page to me and made me

want to get to the table and cast those

suckers and see what happens right

that's a that's always a sign of a great

asset in an RPG book it just makes you

want to sit down and play

secondly is the classic DCC

has this craziness to it and it's almost

the the counter example to everything

that I'm saying it's very list driven

it's very table driven the outcomes of

spells are very driven by details in big

tables you always have the book out

you're always you know scanning down

these 1D 100 type tables and finding

these outcomes and uh the uh the curses

and the the Mercurial results of failed

roles and all this stuff is in these

huge tables and that's the DCC way it's

really worth looking at because there's

so much cool flavor in that game it's

just undeniable but at the table I found

it pretty cumbersome to use

of course there's dungeon world you guys

know that I'm a huge fan of dungeon

World dungeon World took the hack to

tears and sort of short list methods

right dungeon world does not have an

expansive spell list they're pretty

simple they involve plus ones and

smallest amounts of damage and they're

very simply described and there's not a

lot of them but I just felt the way that

they fit into character progression

especially maybe for one or two shot

type games

is very easy to understand and very fast

at the table it would be easy to be a

wizard in Dungeon world

the next one is in some ways the

opposite which is the Burning Wheel now

if you haven't read The Burning Wheel I

strongly strongly recommend it just as

an alternative way of thinking about

RPGs it is a fascinating brilliantly

written book

um

they used the shortlist method as well

it's a short spell list but where they

really really hit the road is that the

Spells match the world and the tone of

the game

it's very specific it has this textural

feel that's very unique to The Burning

Wheel that gives you that feeling of

like oh yeah man we are in The Burning

Wheel here this is the this is that tone

so give that a look

there's two more and this is the mother

of all magic systems a game called ours

Magicka

so if you're not familiar with it it's

maybe a little bit lesser known RPG but

ours Magicka is a very historical

European setting

with a highly expansive and detailed

spell casting and creation system based

on hermetic magic so hermetic magic is

this sort of a very historical feeling

magic that uses Latin that uses uh you

know like conversion of elements that

uses very real feeling Magic

and R's Magicka since the whole focus of

the game is the creation and use of

magic they embraced the formless magic

approach to the ultimate they have a

system of combining nouns and verbs to

create spells right like what's a funny

one create water right I gotta go guys I

gotta create water

it lets players use nouns and verbs to

actually create spells and there's a

whole expansive system on how to limit

power up enhance and simplify and

complexify

those player created spells and it's

absolutely brilliant now if you want to

be at the table with this that's a

different discussion for me again I am

not the sharpest tool in the shed so I

would have a hard time running ours

Magicka quickly at the table I played it

years and years ago but I think we

played two sessions and we realized it

was just really neat making the

characters and then we couldn't we got

very uh klutzed up in the session but

give it a look and you don't have to buy

these books to to give them a read

there's wikis for all this stuff

finally we've got good old DND

d d took basically almost the opposite

um approach to everything that I've been

discussing in this talk so they have the

long spell list they have very arbitrary

rule variation between the Spells and I

I don't know about you guys but I find

it hard to remember and easily write

down their spells and especially when

I'm watching players

even a druid who in my mind should have

simple naturalistic spells needing spell

cards and needing you know pages of

notes on remembering how to do these

spells and trying to save time at the

table to me that's the sign that

something can be better now I know that

people out there love it and people can

memorize these spells over time and man

those are very valuable players but

again

I'm just describing my point of view and

mine is I want better magic in my game

that's more mine that belongs more to me

and my players and that's what this RPG

talk has been all about so

take ownership of your spell list hack

down your spell rules into discreet

tears and finally embrace the approach

of formless or player created magic that

is how to solve the big spell list

problem the clumsy evil Caster problem

and make magic yours in your world

thanks for tuning in everybody this is

brandish gilhelm and you are listening

to Rune hammer

[Music]

thank you

[Music]


[Music]

thank you

this is Rune hammer

RPG talks design Theory q a and counter

methods story building DM deep thinking

and game building it's all right here so

strap in and may your dice roll High

greetings programs it's anchor and

Ferndale back once again Old Branch

Gilham here with roon hammer and we're

getting into some RPG talks this is

episode four

and I'm excited about this episode

because step toad this is an epitode

[Music]

it's like a really big toad it's an

epitode

I'm excited about this one because I am

eyeballs deep in a dungeon design right

now and I am right at the center of this

very discussion so before we get into

how to provide a deep and potent theme

to your next dungeon

let's take a look in the mailbag

[Music]

mail back there mail back day let's go

see what's in the mail today

all right so uh rummage around in here

let's see what we got

what do we got here a lot of bunch of

pile of papers here they fall down out

of that hole in the ceiling and land in

this bin here here we go

all right first question is about can

you have more than one GM or dungeon

master at your table

and if so and that's what is wanting to

happen how do you manage that

well that's an interesting question and

first of all that's a great problem to

have if uh in your group at your

tabletop you've got two people that are

really itching to be the dungeon master

boy that that can be a really good

situation because you can give each

other relief

now if you've got several players and

maybe you both won a dungeon master you

want to collaborate on it the most

common way that I know to do that is to

have a sort of a judge or referee and

then to have what I like to call monster

mind and monster mind is the second GM

and his only or her only job is to

control

the key monsters so they don't need to

control like every Goblin or every ghoul

but if you have especially if you have a

Caster or a dragon or something big and

awesome a pit fiend or something a

complex enemy it's great to have a

person who's trying to play that enemy

to the best of their ability now I've

got to put a word of warning on this if

you do go with monster mind it is far

far deadlier than having your normal

narrative uh DM running the monster when

you have someone whose only job is to be

devious and to use all the powers of a

monster and stare at that character

sheet that monster has oh boy do they

get they get as deadly as a player and

so be ready for that as the The

Narrative or referee DM if that's your

role

monster mind is super deadly the other

way that I've seen it done is to

alternate and this is a way to provide

sort of prep relief so what you do is

the two of you get down on a

collaborative sort of set of story Hooks

and then each week or each session you

alternate who runs the game and the

other one can either play maybe a sort

of an NPC

or just have ongoing characters that

duck in and out of the group The One

sort of Pitfall you want to avoid when

it comes to doing the collaborative DM

style is you got to watch out for

running DM PCS now you guys have

probably heard of these right it's like

a an NPC who is run by a DM who's kind

of cooler than a player these are

demoralizing uh if you have NPCs that

can do more and are more powerful and

cooler parts of the story than your

players it is really demoralizing and

frustrating to players so don't do that

if you have your collaborating DM

running an NPC make them like the guy

who has to carry the gear or the

hireling who's you know most likely to

die he's more like a red shirt than he

is Captain Kirk and that way the players

continue to be the so-called yellow

shirts or the the key staff and that DM

controlled NPC is more there to maybe do

a double cross or maybe to reveal a plot

hook or maybe to just sort of serve a

pre-ordained agenda or function that the

the collaborative DMS have agreed on all

right uh what do we got here next piece

of mail looks like

playing two characters so simple sort of

duplicity question that came in this

past week

um got a group with this uh this

gentleman here who has a dungeon master

and two players so their whole group is

three people I actually think that this

can lead to some of the best Gameplay at

the tabletop now it's a little less of a

party when you gather like it doesn't

quite feel like let's all drink soda and

eat chips all night

um it's a little more intimate than that

but as far as the gameplay goes it can

be really fun to have a smaller group so

in their group it felt so small just two

player characters didn't seem very

exciting so they're each gonna try to

play two characters for a total of four

characters in the group right and he's

asking me you know is this okay is it

gonna get difficult is it weird is it

you know how what's the best way to do

it

well my angle on playing two characters

uh it's because you're in such a small

group is it's really actually quite

simple and it's definitely a good idea

you want a nice full feeling Adventure

Party especially for the sake

unfortunately of casualties if you only

have two people in your adventuring

group like the odds of anyone dying are

just very low unless it just is gonna

undo the story right you need a little

bit of of casualty and a little bit of

attrition in a group to make danger feel

real so yes definitely run two

characters but here's how you do it you

have a main and you have a sidekick

the main does all the cool talking and

has an accent so like I am the main

character and I have deep motivations

and an interesting accent from a

non-descript European country okay but

your Sidekick doesn't really say much he

can actually just speak in player voice

and almost speak in like a metatone you

know like you can sit and talk about him

in third person you know uh Jose uh

jumps across the pit

right but then Fernando who's the main

character he gets to say cool lines he

gets you know all this kind of Flavor

now the thing you don't want to do is

demote the sidekick on his power on his

mechanical capability because you need

that capability in your group your DM is

counting on four capable characters

so make him story and personality nerfed

but not mechanically nerfed and this

will keep your table flowing it'll keep

you less sort of multiple personality

confused and it'll keep what's happening

focused around those two main characters

and the two sidekicks can maybe rise and

fall can maybe one of them can get

killed and it's not the end of the world

um or maybe it is maybe like the revenge

over your Sidekick becomes the the focus

of your story and they serve as a fun

supporting character and keep them in

that role

all right our third piece of mail this

week for mailbag day is

this is an interesting one um

basically the question was okay I have

this set up I have this floating pyramid

I have the city and then there's

Intrigue we get up there and then

there's this waterfall and there's this

dark magic thing and then there's this

spell pool and they go everything they

go up to the thing they go to

and then the final sort of uh statement

was I have all this stuff but what am I

missing

and then I'm like I'm reading the thread

and I'm like uh wait a minute let me

scroll up a second here

I look and

it's just this this wealth of goodies

like all these cool little treats and

great moments and they're interlocking

with a cool and and exciting story

that's kind of open-ended and not

everything is over to explain and I just

like man this looks great you're not

missing anything

I think a lot of us as dungeon Masters

feel this sensation right you you set up

a few bullet points you you know that

you know there's kind of this area over

here and maybe this area maybe there's a

branch right here and then there's a big

scary thing and then there's a little

bit of a reveal

right and then you're kind of looking at

your work and you're like I don't know

it's just where's the where's the

Beating Heart here where's the the hot

blood a pumping

this is a good time to take a breather

and uh as Don forgecast says you know

maybe go take a walk for a second the

thing you're missing is players

your prep should feel a little bit

Hollow a little bit empty a little bit

unfinished matter of fact the the more

finished it feels the the more

oppressive it can be to players

if anything you're just sort of mowing

the lawn for the football players to

come out and run around and go crazy so

as you stare at the empty football

stadium yeah I mean there's something

missing

the teams the players the the collisions

the the ball flying the people cheering

you're not doing those things during

prep those things happen during play so

it's just a little bit of an affirmation

you guys know I'm all about like mantras

and power words and coaching yourself

into being smarter and better at what

you're doing and this is a good time to

learn one of those mantra-like behaviors

if you've got a nice little set of prep

you're feeling pretty good about it but

you get this kind of flat moment or flat

sensation where like your limbic system

doesn't just light up

good time to breathe take a little break

rely on your players to fill in that

grout and just move on

another great quote that I like is Tim

from tabletop terrorist said you can't

have the same conversation twice and so

it's important not to overly simulate a

conversation that you're going to have

in the future with players because then

to you it's going to feel like the

second time and you don't want that you

want that that spontaneous in the moment

sensation

as your players discover the

conversation the same way that you would

discover the conversation as you're

doing your bullet points before a

session you're kind of going oh whoa and

then I could oh and maybe and then oh

yeah

don't go too far because you you want to

feel that at the table

so the answer to that piece of mail

you're not missing anything my friend

just your players and sitting down at

the table in a nice you know glass of

Mountain Dew that's right drink Mountain

Dew out of a glass

be a grown ass man

because sometimes you just want to drink

Mountain Dew out of a damn jar

okay okay okay so that's mailbag thanks

everybody for sending in your questions

and stories and comments on Facebook as

well as straight to my email you can

also throw comments up here on patreon

all right now let's get down to the guts

let's get down to the red stuff inside

Chucky's little rubber head all right we

are talking about theming Dungeons how

to give your dungeon a distinct robust

theme

okay so before we dive into the

techniques and the how to's and the

inspirational statements let's take a

close look at the question on the table

here what is a well-themed dungeon and

why should I care right what what is

this question why did it get voted on in

the poll which thanks everybody for

sounding off

after a little while of playing d d

you'll start to notice certain Elements

which we some call sometimes call tropes

in our drinking game here here at Rune

hammer

the reason we drink when we hear the

word Trope is because it reminds of it

because it reminds us of Elder days

right it reminds us of the beginning

when you can have a five foot square

Stone Corridor that turns left up ahead

in the darkness and that was exciting

that was all you needed because you were

either new to things or because you're

getting back to basics or whatever right

but that would be a good example of a of

a dungeon that really doesn't have a

theme it's it's default

and I think for a lot of us especially

because you're here at runehammer your

your interest in roon Hammer is to

master the art of dungeon mastering

right so the last thing probably that

you get excited by

is a dungeon that you're working on that

doesn't really have a theme to it so you

find yourself saying well I I need

something here I need juice

I need something to inspire me is what

we we generally say

unfortunately inspiration can be an

exciting term but it really doesn't give

you any meat to chew on it doesn't give

you any any fiber to hold things

together it just gives you sort of raw

excitement

so if we want to talk about giving a

dungeon a nice dope theme

what we want is material we can use so

you guys know my my stance on things is

that this art that we do this hobby that

we do is all about specificity it's all

about specific things that you can do or

use

and the saturation that we're seeing in

the hobby right now of generality

is to me less helpful so let's take a

look at very specific ways and specific

things and pieces of creative substance

that you can use to give your next

dungeon or the one you're working on

right now a heavy hitting robust

scary inspiring poetic spooky deadly

mystical Eldritch theme

okay so I have nine items nine items to

theme them all

six to make them awesome and three not

to do

okay I'm not talking but I do have nine

things that part is real all right

the first thing that I want you to do

that I invite you to do is what I

mentioned in Dungeon building 101 last

week and then I'm going to keep

reinforcing find your core power word

and you have to commit to that Core

Power word this is a single word that

you're going to return to again and

again now it doesn't have to be the

title of your Dungeon Because we all

know we love to have cool titles to our

dungeons right

but you need a single descriptive Core

Power word that every time you draw a

blank you can look at that word it's

written in bold text with a goofy Wiggly

circle around it in your journal and you

can improvise or remember

a tiny or large fact about the dungeon

you could make a room based on this core

word

this core word is everything and you

really do have to invest in the core

word you can't take it lightly you have

to see it as far as it can possibly go

now today's RPG talk is directly tied

into the next sort of crisscross event

that I'm working on right now so on

YouTube You're Going to Be Seeing

dungeon building 101 Part 2. and then

here on patreon we've got this RPG talk

and we've got a short story coming up

that matches the video on YouTube so all

three things interlock

I'm having a lot of fun

interlocking these different elements

and thinking deeper but I'm still

circling around this one Core Power word

and in this one I I tried to find a

little more of a challenging one

my Core Power word for this specific

dungeon build that I'm doing is tunnel

I want to build a tunnel dungeon

now you're saying wait don't all

dungeons just have a bunch of tunnels no

not at all totally not and remember we

go all the way in on our Core Power word

so when I think of a tunnel it's time to

instantly say what does that mean not

just well that's it could be a corridor

no a tunnel and a corridor are not the

same thing

a tunnel

is all kinds of specific things it's

it's cut out usually to have a rail car

go through it it's usually cut under as

a travel sort of mechanism it's not like

a maze like a dungeon right it's usually

straight or slightly curved

a tunnel

I associate like maybe some water

running and some cave-ins because

tunnels are sort of hastily created to

do transport transport is part of a

tunnel

um a tunnel is often secret with a sort

of a secret entrance and exit so that

you can transport again coming back to

this kind of it's a it's a highway

Underground

a tunnel is straight for the most part

and that's that's something that I can

really take to the bank on this dungeon

it's a it's a stinking straight line

guys

when was the last time you made a

dungeon that was literally just a

massive straight line like two miles

straight line that's a tunnel so you see

what I'm doing is I don't really know

how all these answers are going to play

out but once I have my power word

I I start to see them the answers start

coming and just let them come apply the

Osborne method

suspend the Judgment of your responses

to your power word until later maybe

you'll need to cut them down because

you'll have too many ideas

so that's my first tip and you guys knew

I was going to say it for theming your

dungeons is pick your core power word

and for bonus points maybe that Core

Power word matches what's coming next in

your campaign maybe your characters have

gone up to the volcano and so you know

that your power word is going to be

magma

or your power word is going to be Lava

you know or your power word is going to

be Tremor or something like to that

effect you know that your character is

in the swamp so your your power word is

going to be mud

or swamp swamp is a little bit of a

general one but hell if you lean in on

it you get all these dividends but you

have to make it one word

okay so you're building your dungeon and

you've got your power word right you've

got it written down we're doing this

like a worksheet right now so everybody

in class has gotten their power word

written down okay next you're going to

write a little bullet so it says the

whole truth

now this is a bit more nuanced and a bit

more complex

but you're going to need at least one

sort of fact about your dungeon

you need a fact that basically explains

why it is there what it is and why it's

there

the whole truth and often

the players will not get access to this

they may investigate their way around to

it

but they will often not get the whole

thing exposed to them

okay so the specifics of the whole truth

for the dungeon that I'm building this

tunnel

is that this tunnel was used in secret

in Elder days

to get forces from the tower in the

center of town out to the edge of town

so that they could come up behind any

sieging forces and attack them from the

rear that's why this tunnel was made

but in recent years there's been some

collapses and there have been some

monsters that have started to occupy the

tunnel and people don't really go down

there anymore that's it that's the whole

truth

you do not need any more remember

brevity is King because it lets you

remember things so if you're writing the

whole truth and it's a paragraph you're

never going to remember the paragraph

unless you're smarter than I am which is

probably almost everyone listening to

this podcast

I can keep a sentence in my brain I

cannot keep a paragraph in my brain and

you want it in your brain

so your first bullet core word power

word right then right underneath it the

whole truth why is this here well the

dragons in ancient times needed a

structure they could defend so that they

could hatch their eggs in secrecy there

you go

or you know the Cults of Garrett Frack

actually built this big mud Palace

where they could all grow sahagwin

demons in this weird gelatinous goo okay

done even that got a little long

okay the whole truth is an extension of

your power word but it's basically going

to give you this kind of who what why

where and when kind of stuff so as

players are investigating and you don't

have all the answers written down I hope

you don't because that sounds Impossible

Players have so many wildly varying

questions

the whole truth is going to give you

this sort of root or Center of knowledge

that's going to let you answer questions

in an improvised way that will always be

consistent

so let's take my example then we have

this tunnel that was hewn long ago as a

way to break sieges so we know that the

entrance and exit are need to be secret

otherwise sieging forces would be able

to use it to attack right

I also know that it was probably hastily

built there's there's something

interesting there

I also know that military stuff is

probably present

especially near the entrance and exit

there may be our weapon racks or other

military supplies

I also can sort of situate this tunnel

in my world in a way that it will serve

this function and so I can kind of know

if if this is you know Salient to the

adventure I'll kind of know where it's

gonna be

and finally I know where my tunnel is

going to end it's going to end at the

central tower of this town because that

was its function it was the forces hold

up in the tower during a Siege could

empty out and get out into the

countryside

so I I know a lot of the ins and outs of

my tunnel and then I know this other

little piece lately it's fallen into

disrepair

and I can improvise into that both in

the design as well as answering

questions from players

okay our next item the third item you

have your core word you have the whole

truth now I want you to write down tie

in there is one tie-in

in this dungeon what's a tie-in now a

tie-in is something that links the

players to this place

little detail a little fact that they

find or stumble upon that that ties them

to this place

the way to ask this question is what do

my players have to do with this dungeon

not why are they here

what do they have to do with it

what history do they share with it and

find a way

the first response is going to be oh

well they just came to this dungeon

because they heard they're a treasure

here and they're just plundering it

right okay great but now they're gonna

find this connection

they're gonna find a skeleton in one of

the hallways and around the skeleton's

neck is a locket and it's one of the

player's sister

she was here and she was killed by an

acid trap there you go that's a tie-in

they're going to be exploring a dungeon

and they find a tapestry that portrays

them exploring the dungeon looking at

the tapestry of them exploring the

dungeon

another one could be they find a symbol

on the floor that matches a symbol that

one of the characters has on an amulet

you see what I'm doing I'm looking for a

way to go there's a connection here do I

know what the connection is and what it

fully means hell no I don't have time

for that I'm a normal person

but I can write tie in and there's going

to be a little moment now eventually

you're probably going to want to explain

it but if you're carry your characters

are not hungry for that explanation then

you can let it go it's still going to be

cool in the moment

maybe there's uh ghosts and spirits in a

dungeon and one of them is the

grandfather of one of the characters you

know family is always such a great way

to do a tie-in history childhood

um accoutrement you know like your your

equipment is somehow related to the

equipment that you discover

symbolism or epigraphic symbols are

shared between a tattoo and architecture

these are all great things that work

over and over again

they make players feel like they their

characters really are integrated into

the world in surprising ways and you

don't even need to know the full

explanation but just find one little

tie-in it doesn't have to do with any of

your mechanics it doesn't really even

have to do with your core word but if it

does bonus points right because you're

always coming back to the core word so

in my case

my core word is tunnel

so let's see I think that since I have

this sort of time fracture going on in

the ranges of numidia they're going to

stumble across

Helm

but he got stuck in the Narrows of this

tunnel because it gets very narrow I for

some reason I see narrow in my mind

and he got with all his armor and his

Spears and everything he got stuck and

his his skeleton is there and he finds

his own skeleton stuck in the tunnel and

it's been there for a long time what the

hell

explain it later

but that's the tie-in and then it makes

those Narrows even scarier

okay so that's my tie-in for my tunnel

that's item number three

item number four is probably the one

that popped in your mind when you guys

were voting for how to theme a dungeon

so we've got our core word we've got the

whole truth we've got a tie-in that

makes the players feel a part of it and

now what we want to do is get into

senses and substance

what are things made of

how does this place stimulate the senses

but remember we're writing in a journal

so you don't get a lot of words here

so I would probably just write the word

substance

and then I would basically say

Wet Stone

broken Stone flowing water

probably actually it

supplies there you go that's another

keyword I want there to be supplies in

this tunnel because that was its

function

yeah and I think I'm starting to see it

so senses and substances basically the

shortest list you can come up with to

answer what things look smell sound and

feel like as players are moving through

the space are there stalactites is it

outdoor is it the sunny day is it a

rainy night is it underground is it

you know smooth pavement is it a stone

work from ancient times

giving one or two answers here can later

let you give a bunch of answers so you

start probably starting to see a pattern

here we're looking for ways to write in

our journal in ways that we don't have

to write a million words down but later

we'll have a million words so senses and

substance is the most literal way to

describe your dungeon now that feels a

little general right so how do you get

specific with senses and substance well

honestly a clever dungeon master could

just look right back to his whole truth

and see the senses and substance right

there well there's for my tunnel there's

tool marks all over the walls

the the the floor of the tunnel is

tracked with iron boot like scrapes

right where like hundreds of men in

armor have run through this tunnel over

and over

there are all these crates and barrels

that used to or still have Spears and uh

maybe there's some like an oil slick and

so on and so forth throughout the tunnel

maybe there's a like derelict Railway

that they use to move all their weapons

and armor down the tunnel quickly or

even to move men

so see how my whole truth is giving me

senses and substance and then what does

it sound like down here well it's like

this long narrow Tunnel right so it's

like you can see a little flickering

light in the distance

there's sort of this scary feeling of of

oppressive Darkness there's a lot of

echo

so sounds are very confusing

the easy to sneak down a tunnel but not

if someone's there because there's

nowhere to hide it's a freaking tunnel

so you see my my senses come out of my

whole truth but more so it's just as I

work through this process I'm getting

more and more mentally in the tunnel or

in whatever your dungeon may be

okay now the next one is one of my

absolute favorites

this is excuses for danger

I want you to take your core word and

your whole truth

and make up a bunch of excuses of why

things are going to be difficult now one

thing that's fun in every dungeon is

that things are a little bit oddly

difficult right it's like you have to

jump over a little Gap right and it's

like you know a DC of 15 right and you

need your your plus five decks to make

this jump right but if you were just out

in the in a sunshiny day you could

easily jump this little Gap but there's

wet moss on the rocks or the edges of

the rocks are crumbling or the ceiling

is drooped with vines that you get

tangled in or there are weird tentacles

or black goo that's making your boots

stick

finding a way to make danger excuses

that fit

is a way that's going to bring all this

sort of narrative flavor we've been

doing and bring it down to the

mechanical level

and what you can do is once you start

finding more of these danger excuses you

can start escalating them okay so let's

take my tunnel for example

the best danger excuse I can see in my

tunnel is the narrowness of it and the

straightness there's nowhere to you know

there's no open space to hide

and in spots it gets so narrow that you

can get stuck and it's very difficult to

draw weapons it's very difficult to

fight it's very difficult to move

you're definitely going to be single

file and you all know how terrible being

single file can be if you're fighting

monsters

and if let's say I want them to jump the

ceiling is so low it's really hard to

make a jump and in spots the ceiling

gets down like three feet high and then

you need to jump over a gap like I don't

even know that's like that's some

American ninja stuff right there so you

see what I'm I'm just taking my one idea

and I'm finding all these dumb reasons

that everything can be difficult

now sometimes it's going to be really

easy let's say your power word is magma

well geez magma is definitely dangerous

just in and of itself but how can you

play with it well it's coming out of the

walls it's below the floor the floor is

giving way the heat is oppressive in

certain areas so much so it's hard to

even see oh man I got a difficult

perception on a roll on my hands right

why why did I fail that perception why

is my perception DC 18 with all this

heat and smoke is rising off this magma

and you can see like four feet

danger excuses are gonna bring it all

down they're gonna let you turn your

narrative concept into mechanical

difficulty

now I don't even know if you really need

to fully write all these down but I

think always writing two or three

bullets below a little category is going

to help you so danger excuses you could

say for magma for example you could say

oppressive heat and you can say you know

always under the floor and behind the

wall

so anytime somebody crashes into a wall

they have a chance of revealing some

magma and then everything's going to get

more difficult because you can't be

touching it

or you can also use it as a as a dungeon

World partial success right let's say

you get you jump a uh a gap

but you barely succeed well you take one

damage because one of your boots kind of

dipped in a little bit of magma there

so you see like you only need a couple

and then press them and press them and

make it more and more difficult so with

Magma you can see where it's headed

you're going to wind up in a place where

there's a couple little floating rocks

and a big sea of magma and the

difficulty is through the roof because

it's so hot you can barely see your foot

can get dipped in there your weapons

might fall out of your hand and go in

the magmas yet all these wonderful

excuses for things being terribly

dangerous

okay now the next one you're not even

gonna write down

the next one is a method that you're

going to apply it's a mindset you're

going to put yourself in and it's a big

part of being a dungeon master in

general

and this is you want simple big facts

and you want complex nuanced and

detailed small facts

what the hell you talking about hand

confernel

big facts are what we've already talked

about your core word your whole truth

your right that's why why is this here

what is this place you've already got

that figured out those are your simple

big facts and you're going to keep them

so simple that they're easy to remember

this was once a temple to a snake God

it's now sunken into the marsh there you

go that's my simple big fact

now here's where it gets interesting

complex nuanced and detailed small facts

this is what it feels like When You

Reach Out And Touch the runes on the

wall

if a player does that and wants to know

what what they're experiencing this is

where you need some goodies and you need

them to be small

right it's like soapstone but it's been

wet so long that it has this sort of

layer of slime on the outside but as

your fingers slide down it they reveal a

dry coarse sort of sandstone underneath

the glyphs that are hewn here in spots

are oddly unaffected by corrosion

perfectly Square edged but in other

places the slow ooze has all but sort of

rounded them away into Nubs and into

undiscernable blobs

the lever on the door is carved with a

spiral motif

like there you go that's a good one I

had to get in practice

who cares what the level lever on the

door is shaped like right

but the player gets this nuanced little

moment inside their mind of their hand

contacting this little spiral etched

lever

it doesn't have to be some big clue that

you're going to reveal something about

spirals later it's just a nuanced little

small fact

what does the floor smell like if you go

down on one knee and give it a sniff

right what happens if I poke a wall with

a spear

what kind of support structures are

holding this place together is it built

on Timbers or is it just sort of a

leaning Keystone system is it waddling

waddle and Bob waddle and dob

architecture

is it thatch is it a naturally occurring

Cavern

and then

accessing these facts and giving them

tiny little moments the best one that

I've provided so far is the door lever

has spiral Motif the keyhole as you pick

it it's odds and square rather than

oblong like most keyholes in towns and

Villages that you know of it's a simple

Square you've never seen a keyhole quite

like this

the Rope that's dangling above the pit

is not woven in a spiral pattern like

rope that you're familiar with but a

sort of an interlaced Helix pattern that

gives it a crisscross look

and it makes it easier to grip

huh weird so this culture that built

this had more advanced rope making

that's not going to have to do with

something that's not a clue it's just

something it's just a nice little

something and on and on and on so make

simple big facts and nuanced tasty

detailed small facts always make sure

that your world goes all the way down to

one square inch of data what's in that

one square inch is there a an odd

looking ladybug that's green and yellow

that's crawling up the wall

there you go that's not a hint of future

events that's not meaningful in any way

it's just odd and Tiny

okay so there are six things that you

want to do now I've got three dunks

first of all don't worry about

explaining worry about describing and

this you feel the most with simple big

facts and detailed small facts right is

like explaining to a character is or

player is trying to give them all the

cool

uh basically secrets to try to give them

all the info

don't do that just describe specific

things there's a really good chance and

I would say it's 75 percent that the

players will never really Plumb

the the underlying facts of your dungeon

and that's okay you want to describe you

want them to be the star it's just a

football field they're the players so

don't worry about explaining everything

to them just put your mind on describing

things to them

and this leads us right into the second

one don't answer questions they don't

ask just because you know the answers

are cool

you can set up the sickest backstory to

a dungeon I mean this whole thing about

how the the queen fell from on Grace and

she was buried in this tomb and she

plopped through the bottom of the Tomb

and then she actually met this Beholder

and they made friends and then they

became this gelatinous mass and then

they do and then all of it and the

players never find this out

don't answer any any questions that

aren't asked because you wrote the

answers

if players don't really care or have the

interest or the the impetus to find out

how this goo got here

you don't need to provide those answers

or find some excuse to reveal your prep

don't do it

and this is yet another reason to keep

your prep brief because it won't put

that like weird sense of overvaluing

your prep and wanting to expose it to

your players just answer the questions

they ask they're the focus okay now my

last one

of what not to do is directly pursuant

to my idea of a tunnel but my tunnel is

a bit of an extreme answer here

and that is don't hide in twists and

turns

so a lot of people associate twists and

turns with a dungeon right there's a lot

of you know different routes you can go

and there's T intersections and it's

like a hedge maze right

well anyone who has ever really done a

big crawl that has those kinds of

features knows it is very cumbersome and

difficult without a dedicated mapper or

really good detailed terrain on your

table or something to really track

twists and turns in a realistic and fun

way

and this goes back to my old Axiom which

is don't use arbitrary geometry in your

architecture right don't just have a

bunch of twists and turns because twists

and turns that is not a reason that is

not a use now if

this Corridor was built in a zigzag

shape because Warriors hide behind Each

corner and fire arrows that's different

that's a tactical structure

but don't put players through twists and

turns in intersections unless those have

purpose and excitement

and this is why I wanted to try a tunnel

the answer to this final question in my

mind was like can I make a dungeon that

has no turns in it it's just literally a

freaking straight line

and that's when I had the Epiphany to do

dungeon building 101 Part Two is how to

build this tunnel dungeon so don't hide

your intention and your excitement and

twists and turns just do as many as you

need one or two is usually plenty of

intersections and turns you just don't

need a lot of them to get to the fun

a great example is Matt clicks dungeon

design sort of philosophy on Fistful of

dice

which he applied to our oath of the

Frozen King dungeon run that we did a

little ways back and really there was no

navigation at all we just went room to

room

and it was fantastic it was a great

dungeon run we didn't have to figure out

how far to the corner and then go and

like oh we have to go back and which way

were we going oh yeah we're supposed to

go left this time and we didn't do any

of that stuff we got right to the cool

stuff

do that get to the cool stuff

okay guys that is my talk on how to

heavily theme your dungeon but as you

can see the real core of it is that

power word at the beginning

if you believe in that and you can see

the whole truth everything else starts

cascading out and then it's just a

matter of not overdoing your prep not

wanting to force your prep on players is

letting them be the star

and letting that core word take you all

the way from the and letting that core

word take you all the way from the big

Cosmic explanation the historical

explanation all the way down to the bug

crawling up on the spiral etch door

handle

so that's my talk on theming your

dungeon this is RPG talks episode four I

hope you guys had fun I'm definitely

having a great time delving hey hey see

what I did there delving into dungeon

creation ever since that great question

that came up uh what two weeks ago I've

never made a dungeon where do I start

and I realize there's just so many

different approaches that's the fun in

it so getting specific staying brief

that's always going to make all your

work more fun and more fun to sort of

discover Revelations of your own at the

table and uh

you know see what's lurking behind the

next Iron banded door okay guys so keep

an eye out for the short story titled

um the tunnel of hath or door that will

[Music]

thank you


welcome

seeker to the lab

of knowledge

greetings programs welcome back to

another episode of

roon hammer well drunkens and dragons

this is

the new layer of knowledge

and you know that it's new because it's

brighter it's whiter and has more

dangling cords

here is it here or is it here is it here

okay enough

hey we're here to talk about the layer

of knowledge reading

reading is really cool a lot of you guys

have been asking yo

where is layer of knowledge how come you

aren't showing us more cool books that

we should be reading

because reading as a form as mentioned

previously

it's cool man i'm really getting rusty

with this whole

rap routine at the beginning of the

video the reason is because

finding really strong recommendations

in books is very freaking difficult i

don't know if it's just plain hard to

make fantastic books

or if i'm bad at finding them i don't

know which one is

is more true but it's very rare that i

come across

a book or a couple books where i'm just

like oh dang

oh oh dang it stinks it's so good it's

my leg bottom of the your foot

smells like yoda's gym clothes kind of

funk although they never really show

yoda reading

books let's talk about because i got two

whoppers

that you're gonna dig a lot we're not

gonna talk a lot about

uh this guy john michael greer seems

like he is an

accomplished historical writer and so

he's definitely

deep in the uh european history jam

so he has a lot of other books that you

can find on amazon if you really like

him

but i think these two books are for him

these are like landmark books for an

author with a lot of books under his

belt because his other stuff

i don't know but here it's a little bit

and this is what i want to talk about

not just content but how you deliver

content

is so important in book craft and it

sets

books apart even when they talk about

things you can find elsewhere

they're right here oh my god hankert

fairnell you're losing your edge bro

it's all just decoration look at this oh

it's so fancy got foil letters

no these books are way more than super

cool covers now

in their defense these are some of the

best covered and bound books

i own these are fantastic quality books

so these are

the the occult and the conspiracy and

they're just called the book the occult

book

the conspiracy book that's what these

are now before you go jumping to

any conclusions about what these are let

me talk about

why they are such strong recommendations

first of all

the quality of these books is

spectacular like

the materials that they're made of the

weight the feel and the size

great for like late nights sitting in a

leather chair and

really thinking you're something second

the topics okay this is probably the

most like

role play ee element of why i would put

these books onto layer of knowledge here

on the runehammer

these two topics should be huge in your

sort of um

dungeon master lexicon or you're sort of

a

the subconscious knowledge that makes

you a wicked

dungeon master with a lot of subtext and

nuance

to the adventures that you present to

players the occult

and conspiracies not like conspiracy

theory this this word has really been

dragged through the mud in recent times

because of unfortunate recent events

but a conspiracy in its true form a

secret society a hidden world

is absolutely a core part

of being a great game master a sense for

the historical development of secret

societies

and uh in it just to be clear this is in

the western sense so this does not cover

like

you know the sort of the jade lotus

kind of you know crazy because i know

that in eastern cultures there is

a huge tradition and a vastly complex

subject

about secret societies and and sort of

hidden

stories and a secret world involving

membership

and uh almost a sort of cult-like

membership uh qualifications rituals and

sort of

uh you know behind closed doors

activities and agendas right

so we have the conspiracy stuff over

there and we have the occult stuff over

there

the occult is a little more easy for

just about anyone to see

the link between knowing the history of

the occult

and running d running any kind of

fantasy or even cyberpunk type

games if you have a historical command

of the occult

and i'm not talking about the sort of

maybe the cheesy or

cartoony evocations that might pop in

your mind when you hear the word occult

you know you might think about you know

like zombies or you might think about

you know witches with pentagrams

and and whoo they're raising the dead

and it's you know there's like

teenagers in a basement like cutting

themselves to

you know evoke bills above so that they

can get superpowers

that's honestly is sort of part of the

mindset of the occult

but that is not the historical context

and like

known documented facts of the occult

and that's what these books are about

they're not about the cartoony

components

of these two subjects they are in-depth

chronological descriptions of these

topics

to be a brilliant game master you need

a command of the occult how it began

what does it really mean the occult

really is uh

its origin is in sort of the concept of

being hidden

it is that simple it is not necessarily

about the supernatural

but over time what happened to the word

occult and all that it implies is it

became

associated with the supernatural and

with sort of strange things

that was not an accident that was

well i don't want to spoil it for you

that's the fun of the story that's how

hidden societies that created somewhat

controversial or maybe

underground or counter establishment or

counter metaphysical movements of

thought

began to be considered as evil because

they were counter marketed

not because hey let's go make an evil

society and invoke bills above so we can

get superpowers

no they were legitimate ways of thinking

that were branded and that were brought

into

this sort of negative light that we now

associate with the word occult

by those who would be undermined by them

and

this this sort of twist on the

true history of the occult as well as

conspiracies not

conspiracy theory not you know false

things that get around to explain things

you're uncomfortable about that that is

such a a bad use of the word conspiracy

conspiracy is is a far more useful and

historical word

concerning secret societies and hidden

worlds

a conspiracy theory is basically just

mind garbage but this book tracks the

actual growth of the

concept of a secret society

in the western sense so if we take those

two big topics

and we know that by getting these

awesome books you're going to have

a command of those topics at least on a

subconscious level

i don't think you need to remember the

years in which bacchus was worshipped in

greece

i i don't think you need to get right

down into that

but if you at least have an intuitive

command of

how these events unfolded in human

history

which honestly i think i did before

but when i was reading through these i

felt brand new to both subjects because

the writing is so clear and this is a

pretty decent segue to the next thing i

wanted to talk about

this is the format one side is always a

huge image

taken from historical sources and the

other side is a single page

concerning a single sort of granular

topic in the chronological explanation

now this may seem like a no-brainer

right well you put a picture over here

and you put like

two columns of text over here for this

topic alone

it never gets to go on to another page

it has to only be right there

kind of a no-brainer right it's like

well sure that sounds great a lot of

children's books are made that way

that's how monster at the end of this

book is made one of my all-time

favorite books and the monster at the

end of the what

i don't want to spoil it they only let

you do each topic

it could be huge it could be freemasons

this is a massive topic and if you take

freemasons

in say the mid-18th century and i need

to find a way to get

one specific granule of this explanation

onto two columns of text on a square

page this is challenging

in my opinion writing great books is

always a subtractive process

you have more than you can convey and

you need to

get your reader not only to invest and

to stick

but then to retain and so the less and

the less and the less you can cut this

sculpture down to its essence

the more effective it is and these books

are super effective

because you don't get tired of one thing

even something as fascinating as the

hellfire

club which is for me one of my my

favorite sort of little eddies in

history one of the weirdest

sort of most easy to fantasize elements

of secret societies if you don't know

about the hellfire club

definitely it's time to start doing your

research it is

it's almost like you couldn't write a

better way to create a bunch of

adventure hooks

it's so gnarly and it it's visually

it evokes sort of images almost like

eyes wide shut if you guys have seen

that

crazy wonderful film it takes you into

this world

that is ripe for adventure and for

discovery and for

you adding your own secrets that will be

revealed

but as i was saying even a topic that

huge that fascinating

it gets one page it gets one image and a

couple columns of text and that's all it

gets

now that doesn't give you everything

you're going to need if you really want

to be a scholar of these topics

but what it gives you is something

memorable

something tight enough that you retain

not only each little piece

but the sequence and that sequence to me

is what's so key to upping your game

master game

intuitive comprehension of what the

occult

and sort of conspiracies and secret

societies really

are about have been about in a

historical sense

no bs no cartoon land what has

actually transpired cooked down by a

brain who seems to have a

really masterful command of the material

so

the books are really well made the

formatting

is like a pedagogical dream

and the content of it is really salient

to being a cool game master and so for

me

finally after how long has it been like

maybe a year and a half since the layer

of knowledge has

you know been on my channel i finally

have two books that i

strongly recommend you have as part of

your game masters library

these are killer they're great too

because they don't get into this sort of

fanboy type mindset like man do i think

the occult is cool

i mean i do but that perspective doesn't

make

a scholarly sort of rigorous tone

come forth like being a fanboy of it

sort of

in my mind can lend too much to a

subject like the occult or like

you know secret societies thinking

there's actual magic happening ooh

you know like there's there's actual

supernatural power changing hands here

that may be the case but

arguing that in a book is never going to

succeed it's just not going to happen

there's no evidence there's no facts

if there were we wouldn't have such a

cagey view of the supernatural

i like that this author approaches this

in an

almost skeptical extremely dry scholarly

fashion

but with such a comprehensive and clear

writing style

just slays the game so if you have the

complete chronicles of conan

if you have the necronomicon if you have

101 things i learned in architecture

school

and some of these other clutch books

that i have described on the layer of

knowledge as being like

essential for being a great game master

you need these two books the occult book

and the conspiracy book by john michael

greer now if i was smarter and cooler at

the internet i would know how to do like

affiliate links and i could make a

fortune when you all go to buy these

books

but i'm not like that i got lizardmen to

paint back here

i don't have time to make affiliate

links so go get the book tell me what

you think

you guys that's it i'm out man

these lizardmen aren't gonna paint

themselves peace

don't you get off get out of me

come on get

hey you all right dang sorry about that

got a little excited about the layer of

knowledge

that's gonna hurt in the morning


[Music]

thank you

this is Rune hammer

RPG talks design Theory q a and counter

methods story building DM deep thinking

and game building it's all right here so

strap in and may your dice roll High

welcome back everybody to another

episode of RPG talks here on Rune Hammer

good to have you guys um well September

is is coming to a close here and wow

it's crazy to think that

um the runehammer patreon only started a

month ago it's already kind of been a

wild ride thank you as I say so many

times to all of you for supporting that

will keep this whole thing going and

honestly it just makes everything that

I'm working on go further deeper

crazier than ever before so you know my

goal it's not only to survive but to

thrive not only to do but to Excel and

that's what we're gonna do and that

brings me to the subject of today's RPG

talk I had a funny comment come up I

think it was on the Viking death squad

video

um very short comment kind of a Kurt

little comment that basically just said

you're a Railroader

and my response was like okay LOL

but

not everyone May realize it but every uh

little comment on Twitter and on YouTube

and everywhere uh those little comments

get to people that are creating material

for the internet they they reach us at

least for me I can speak for myself

um every once in a while a comment will

just Pierce through uh all the other

conversations and threads that are going

on

and it'll make you think even though you

know like I was probably just a passing

comment it's probably not a big deal but

I thought to myself

I'm not a Railroader what why would I

why would someone accuse me of being a

real railroading is bad

and that brings us to the subject of

today's RPG talk railroading what is it

really

now I think railroading is a term that

is tossed around in our hobby as much as

op which you guys probably have seen

that video where I kind of go crazy on

the overuse and incorrect use of the

term overpowered but I would say that

railroading is very very commonly used

and inappropriately used I think it's

mainly used

to just sort of troll other people that

are creating RPG content I don't think

it's generally used in a thoughtful way

it's sort of a pejorative or derogative

derogatory

um

term that I think it's just sort of

tossed out there right like poop on you

poop on what you're doing you're a

railroad or blah

but in fact it is a very useful term

because it is something that you don't

want to do and it's worth thinking about

what it means both so that you as a

dungeon master can feel great about how

you're doing

your work your play your adventures your

stories you want to feel good about them

and also it's useful to think about

because they are pitfalls that you want

to avoid you don't want to be a

Railroader

and even if you are or aren't you don't

want a player to feel like they're being

railroaded and that's where we really

start to get to the true essence of what

the term means okay so before I go much

further let me just give you my

fundamental thesis

on what it really means it comes in two

parts

railroading is not an active Behavior

or activity of a dungeon master

railroading is

a reactive Behavior by dungeon Masters

and here in we get the most sort of

visibility into what this term really

means especially from a player's

perspective which is where it really

matters the most okay so let's dissect

those two things a little bit okay

first of all what is not railroading

I I think that this is important to look

at because if sometimes you're having

some self-doubt like I do all the time

about you know well I just kind of wrote

this story out and there's really only

three rooms for this this session

tonight and you know I'm going to go

ahead and have the Paladin have a sort

of a holy you know encounter with her

God and it's going to be awesome and a

level up and then there's this other

thing this guy's going to appear and

turns out he's his brother and stuff and

that'll be really cool and then you'd

lean back and you're like oh man am I

just like force feeding this whole

session okay

railroading is not having a strong plot

whether that plot is your campaign

whether that plot is your adventure

whether it's even the next five minutes

of gameplay

if you have the dungeon Mast as the

dunge master have a really clear sense

of sort of what's going on or what's to

come that is not railroading so feel

good about it

secondly railroading is not playing

through a linear sequence of events that

is not being railroaded

sometimes sequences of events play out

in a linear fashion and that's okay

that's not railroading that's just stuff

happening think about your day each day

you supposedly are a completely

free-willed creature right with an

infinite number of choices that confront

you every single day when you wake up

but generally most of the time you're

proceeding through linear series of

events that you sort of either need to

do want to do or are obligated to do in

some way and that doesn't make you feel

like oh the universe is just ringing my

neck right now I'm just being led by the

nose no you're not you're still making

millions of tiny choices at every given

second

and it's the same with RPGs just because

things are happening in a linear fashion

does not make it a railroad

another one railroading is not openly

stating the objective for your players

you have to go kill Garrett frack

that's not a railroad that's what needs

to get done

so

often railroading is described as like

well you know the only way to not

railroad is to uh you know offer this

huge sort of sandbox Universe where the

players can really do whatever they want

and stuff like you know yeah a Sandbox

can definitely avoid railroading but

having a clear objective that you state

is the dungeon master is far from

railroading it's awesome it gives you

purpose it gives you Direction

so feel free to do that as a dungeon

master you're not railroading

another thing that is not railroading is

having only one way out

okay so we're we're navigating these

tunnels underneath the orc Fortress

right and there's twists and turns and

there are traps in there are rooms with

guards in them and then there's one room

where they're sleeping and then they

have a monster chain to the wall in

another room and all this stuff players

are running around

in my mind as the dungeon master I sort

of secretly know there's really only one

way out here

they need to find that one way out oh my

God this is kind of getting crazy that's

not a railroad

just because you have a solution to

things does not make it a railroad so

feel confident in just offering well

they actually have to find the sewer and

take the drain out of the orc tunnels

that's fine if things drag on and get

weird and they can't find it can't

figure it out okay maybe you change its

location a little bit maybe you give

them a really obvious clue maybe you

have a an orc that runs down there and

escapes himself

okay finally railroading is not

knowing what's next as the dungeon

master okay so I'm gonna go into this

Knight of gameplay right and I'm already

pretty sure that the night after this

one is going to be the big dragon battle

that does not make me a Railroader that

just means I have a series of sort of

scenes or themes in my movie that is my

campaign or my group

and those things are going to happen

that's not railroading there are still

as I said before Millions an infinite

number really of tiny choices that

players are going to be making about how

things play out exactly what happens how

did the story go what were the emotions

what Rose what fell what was a surprise

what was boring

none of these things have been

determined by you you're just 100 sure

that the next time your friends come

over we're battle we're battling a big

dragon that does not make you a

Railroader you don't need to leave so

many threads open

that your players are absolutely

determining the entire fate of the

entire story at any given moment no no

no no no you're not railroading if you

know what comes next

now the reason that I spend the last

five minutes talking about what

railroading is not

is as I mentioned I want you guys to do

these things and feel good about it

now it might seem silly but I have this

this kind of trouble all the time when

I'm running games

of doubting if I'm offering this or

wondering if I'm doing that good enough

and then especially every once in a

while just because I've put myself out

in the in a public space I I will get a

flippant or scathing comment like you're

a Railroader you know that's it like

there was no

there was no sentence there's no

punctuation you know how sometimes those

really short comments can feel sort of

the meanest

so those are self-doubts that that of

course I have but just having a strong

imagination as a dungeon master having a

strong thrust of action and thrust of

story is not the same as railroading so

don't be afraid of that word

have a strong thrust have a potent

imagination have a vision of where it's

going let it go there

now when we talk about the players and

how they fit into that vision

now let's take the opposite side what

really is railroading not what it isn't

but how about some examples of things

that are

totally fair to call railroading like

dang you just railroaded that ouch

okay first

saying no

this is one of the most fundamental

accidental behaviors of dungeon Masters

is to say no to a player who wants to do

x y z

and it was not within the dungeon

Masters plan

they don't have any preparation that

fits

the the question or or desire or plan of

the player and they just say no

and well there goes the mood is is

pooped

and often the dungeon master has good

reason

to keep a player out of that region or

from going that direction or making that

choice but find another way and this is

a common Mantra of the new age of

role-playing games is never say no

always say yes but or yes and or yes

then

so you're they're cruising along through

the valley and one of them says well I

don't think we should go here you know

it looks like we're going to get

ambushed let's go east and go around the

valley

the dungeon master may not even know

what's to the east

but instead of saying no you actually

can't go east

with whatever methods

he says yeah you go Easter ways and you

find you know a landslide and it's

difficult going but you continue with

your plan and then there's a rocky field

and you know okay Just Go With It Just

go with it it's okay you can still get

them to the same location just as saying

no is the most rudimentary

and I think most common form of

railroading

now even worse than saying no is to

invent false and unbeatable barriers

that are really a cloaked way of saying

no and this is

sometimes happens because maybe the

dungeon master doesn't have the the

candor

or the courage or the honesty at this

particular moment to just say no and so

they they contrive the answer no

so we want to go east and we want to

climb the castle

instead of saying no you just can't it's

unclimbable okay that would be a bummer

but it's it's pretty straightforward

even worse is when the dungeon master

makes up a bunch of stuff about why you

can't climb the castle and you can you

can feel it as the player this is all

the well there's this this is this super

slick moss and every time you try you

you just can't you just can't

and to me as a player that feels even

worse than just being told hey I don't

really have any prep in that area just

kind of here let me steer you back over

here a little bit so it's like I turn a

corner in oh well yeah there's there are

300 armored Knights there so you can't

go that way it's like what so

[Music]

improvising these false implacable

barriers because you're not comfortable

just saying no I don't really the game

doesn't really go over that direction is

is even worse it's a cloaked form of

saying no

and it can sometimes break player GM

Trust

railroading can also be knowing the

outcome

now

remember railroading is not having one

way out and not knowing what's next but

those are different than the outcome

the outcome of a series of events is

very different than the storyboard of

what's to come the outcome is a word to

me that evokes very specific results at

the end of this adventure you will be

fleeing The Village at the end of this

adventure the king will be dead at the

end of this adventure the Paladin will

have turned evil you know it's like

these very specific outcomes

if you as a dungeon master already have

that in your mind going into the session

your players have no purpose they barely

need to be there

the outcome is what they determine

remember if the king lives or dies this

session you can still

story your way through the dragon

arriving next session okay that's great

but the king living or dying the outcome

the consequences the results of

individual action that is entirely the

purview of the players and if you

interfere with it or predetermine it or

dislike some of the options available

then I'm sorry but you're probably

railroading those players and they're

going to feel it

another one and this is a brutal one as

a dungeon master is buffing yourself

so you see that your players are just

killing it kicking ass and as a response

you over buff yourself you you make your

stuff oddly powerful all of a sudden and

the players feel it now it can be one

thing if you tell the table hey guys

this is just ridiculous you're just

spanking these dudes I'm gonna I'm gonna

uh you know modify this ragged sword

rule here so any of the Orcs you

encounter with ragged swords they're

going to be doing double damage does

that sound fair to everyone okay that's

cool but if you don't

open up to the table like that and under

the table you buff yourself as a dungeon

master to kind of get at them that's not

good and especially if you do it to the

extreme like oh my God I think they're

gonna kill my dragon oh I I don't want

that I wanted him in another story there

again you're pushing the outcome let

them kill your dragon man they're gonna

love it

then worry about the ramifications

there are two more things that are

railroading and they're the two things

that really make me grind my teeth

one is fudging dice

I believe that it is

undermining to everything sacred and fun

about the game and our hobby to fudge

dice for any purpose

to me it is a way of

of playing in a way that a player can't

play

and if you have players fudging dice

then you're just in a room full of

cheaters and and I can't be in that room

so don't fudge dice I can see using a DM

screen for your cards your Miniatures

your notes your rules cheat sheets all

of these things are great and and can be

really cool to be hidden and to reveal

but dice must be rolled in the open they

must

finally

railroading

is a fair word when one condition is met

in a game whether online at a table

anywhere

if players feel frustrated

players

are there to have fun

if they feel frustrated by things that

are happening

and I don't mean you know rolling low on

their D20 or you know because they're

they drank their energy drink too

quickly or their chair is too low right

but I mean because of the way that

events are unfolding and they feel

frustrated or like driven to violence

when they clearly didn't want to or they

feel stymied

then you as the dungeon master are

railroading them and you've got to see

it happening and correct

this is a lot like my analogy that

dungeon mastering can be like DJing a

party

if people stop dancing or stop having

fun

you need to adapt and correct it doesn't

mean that you've ruined everything

everyone makes mistakes and slips off

the Golden path now and again there's no

reason to beat yourself up about it but

if you have a frustrated player or worse

like all of the players are group

frustrated

that they can't just walk down the

street or they can't just go through

this door or they can't just XYZ and the

frustration is visible you really need

to course correct there are plenty of

things in real life that are frustrating

we should never be frustrated playing d

d this is our way of having fun

and this brings us back to the yes and

mindset is like have fun if your game is

frustrating anyone it's not a game

anymore it's now labor

[Laughter]

so there is my big analysis of what

railroading is

and where what railroading isn't and I

hope that'll give you a sense not only

of feeling better about how you're

dungeon mastering and better about

creating stories and strong thrusted

Adventures but also to help you

self-critique which is something that I

just do way too much of I guess it's why

maybe I'm cut of a cloth that is

conducive to this podcast

constantly self-critiquing how good a

story feels how fun a moment is how

free a character is in this particular

little case

and you know it boils down to simpler

and more

human things than you might think a lot

of times dungeon Masters get it in their

mind that for thing to be fun or

surprising or or big

it has to be complex and large and

unfolding a Rubik's cube of Adventure

convolution that is revealed in a

massive epiphany of amazingness

but the truth is at least in my

experience

some of the simplest little things can

be so Rife with freedom

and with nuance and with role playing

and they can be right in the middle of a

sword fight they can be right in the

middle of a gun battle

but if the players at the table have

fellowship and love between each other

and the DM is in a bright mood and is is

letting it all unfold

sometimes just running across a field

and throwing a rock at a thing

can be that moment that huge realization

moment of like remembering why you're

into this hobby so much why you use so

much time preparing and writing and

doing character sheets and finding new

dice that you really like and you know

redoing your character sheet again

sometimes it's those smallest moments

that hold all of this

stuff that you as the dungeon master are

working so hard to feel and realize for

your players

and I often think that railroading

is the result of forgetting that simple

simple fact so you know in the sort of

Twitter sphere there's lots of comments

lots of comments about what's awesome

what's coming up

you know what's old what what people

like and don't like what they're bored

with what they're excited about right

but I think when it really comes down to

being at the table it all fades away

whether you're playing this system or

that system whether you're playing this

Source book or you're making it up on

your own whether you're playing

so-called old school or you're playing

something new and different

systems are not fun

Source books are not fun

sitting and playing with people is fun

and how you get there well everyone has

a million different tastes and no one

should be accused of railroading unless

those players are frustrated unless no

is being said all the time unless the

outcome is so determined already that

the players are just accessories to my

own DM fantasy

but how you get there what you're

playing well we can argue about that

forever and I hope we do because I think

it's fascinating which books are

exciting and which labels and which

systems are rising and falling and which

ones are popular what mechanics are cool

and wear off

but the wrong response is to pick a

thing that you really like and then just

just ring its neck whether you're

insisting on other people that a system

is the best that's a form of railroading

or if you're insisting on your players

that a solution or an outcome to this

encounter is the best or the coolest

that's railroading

and you can feel yourself do it

sometimes out in the real world too

which is a feeling a strong feeling that

accidentally leads you to sort of impose

on another person and when you see that

other person feel frustration you know

you've done it and it's okay

all you have to do is correct and just

say oh man well I didn't mean to squish

on your birthday party there but I'm

gonna have to say waffles are better

than pancakes bro cephus they're just

plain better dude it's not even up for

argument

okay now you gotta fight on your hands

okay so this was my little talk about

what really is railroading

and and I hope it gives everyone just

this feeling of like oh man I I don't

Railroad

yeah I shouldn't be worried about it

actually I'm gonna get back to that

swamp Adventure I was working on you

know where the the mushroom people

it turns out they're not mushroom people

at all they're all human beings who are

turned into mushrooms because the curse

and you gotta go kill the hag because

the hag is keeping the curse going and

she's doing it because she has the

prince in this weird room down below the

swamp

okay well you have to go save the prince

to save the mushroom people is that a

Big Railroad oh hell no there are a

million little choices for players to

make

the what of what happens is definitely

your purview as the dungeon master the

what of the scenes of the big ideas but

the how

the how has to be the purview of the

players and if you take that away from

them you might as well just tell them to

go home

now am I railroading my definition of

railroading

I hope not I hope I've been oops

I hope I've been fair in in considering

all sides to the problem

and really I'm just taking you on my own

internal journey of asking myself do I

railroad my players oh my God

I don't want to do that

and a few times I have been frustrated

in games as a player

I don't know that it always occurs to me

as like the term railroading because I

think it's kind of a mean term I don't

really use in casual uh conversation

but if you're feeling frustration it

could be that your voice isn't being

heard

and if that kind of stuff continues well

it's time for tribunal you know it's

time to to raise your hand and to say

Hey you know

I actually feel like we're kind of just

being shunted down this

this path here to kill this guy I don't

really want to kill this guy

I don't really want to I thought we were

gonna do this other thing and it seemed

like

we got irrationally stopped

so I just wanna what about me it isn't

fair I've had enough now I want my share

can't you see it's an RPG anyway

so I guess it took three episodes of RPG

talks for me to start singing in the

podcast so uh we've officially reached a

higher level of comfort and a lower

level of quality

okay well hey everybody I'm gonna get

out of here we're coming up on a half an

hour I hope this discussion of

railroading was useful to you guys and

thanks everyone for your support in

September

uh this will probably be the last piece

for September and then next week it's

going to be October and we're gonna have

all kinds of fun so we're gonna have the

next two chapters of a burning in New

Haven

um we're going to have some new stuff

that's going to be happening on YouTube

that we're going to bring on over

um there's another chapter of Rangers of

numidia in the works and three more RPG

talks it's going to be great I also want

to do

um a Halloween episode next month

because we all love All Hallows Eve

sawen the coolest of all the holidays

and so we are going to celebrate in

style here at Rhone Hammer thank you

everybody for showing up strength honor

and beer love one another hang in there

and make tomorrow just a little bit

better than today I'll see you soon this

is hanker infernail signing off

[Music]


[Applause]

thank you

this is Rune hammer

RPG talks design Theory q a and counter

methods story building DM deep thinking

and game building it's all right here so

strap in and may your dice roll High

greetings everybody welcome and it's

good to have you back on the show this

is the first episode of RPG talks

um in one of the most productive and

most informative polls that I've ever

run online you guys as an audience

decided that really you wanted some of

the RPG thinking from drunkens and

Dragons to come on over to the podcast

here on runehammer so I'm obviously for

one all for it I love talking about game

design and in particular the methods and

techniques specific ones that you can

employ at your table to make your game

move faster to have more fun and just to

get more dice rolling so let's just jump

into it

to get things started with RPG talks uh

I just wanted to introduce the show so

doing this podcast we're going to do

probably two per month or so and we're

going to cover all of the stuff that

would normally be covered in some of my

longer YouTube videos on drunkens and

Dragons now those videos will still keep

going but it lets me Focus YouTube into

the visual element of what I do and as

far as the thought word written design

element it's much easier and I think

much clearer to delve into that stuff in

the form of a of a podcast so that's

what RPG talks is going to be and this

is the very first episode so it's great

to have you thanks everyone for

supporting Rune hammer on patreon I

really appreciate it you make it all

possible so let's just jump in huh

all right

mail back day mailbag day let's go see

what's in the mail today

so mailbag day is when I take three

messages from my slew of messages that

are coming my way and try to give you

the best answer I can and I just want to

thank everyone for all the questions and

comments that I get on Facebook and

YouTube they're just there are tons of

them and this could be a great Forum to

take some of those most interesting ones

and the ones that I think could help the

most people uh and just give them

in-depth answers rather than the often

sort of Curt or short form messaging

that Facebook can lead to

so we've got three great questions today

the first one is

basically a a problem with low

intelligence characters in uh in a

tabletop game

now it should be in the freedom of

of a player to create a low intelligence

character I mean this is part of the

world this is part of what makes the

variability between people interesting

not everyone is a genius who can

decipher runes on an ancient Doorway to

the Crypt of Nazar goon right

and so low intelligence can actually

make a Charming character it can kind of

focus their efforts elsewhere and it can

leave the the smarts to other characters

in the group and there's numerous uses

to have a low intelligence character in

your group but with this particular

question that came my way it's becoming

well it's becoming a problem at their

table and it's dumbing down their game

so this low intelligence character the

player is using this low intelligence as

a sort of an excuse to always be

cracking wise to kind of be you know

making fun of things to be always

looking for a chance to do a stupid

thing as you know comic relief or

something and this dungeon master who

asked me this question is becoming

pretty frustrated

wondered what they could do to help the

situation

this is not a game design situation

the player that is exhibiting this

behavior is exhibiting just one form of

tabletop bullying behavior that any time

that a player is using a character flaw

or a character trait to disrupt the game

to make other players feel crummy or to

make the dungeon master feel crummy to

basically be a Class Clown or to be a a

sort of lazy bum who sits in the back

you know bullies take many forms but the

first step is recognizing that that's

what this is

anytime someone is wanting to hog table

time or take away the fun that another

person is having blaming the traits that

their character has is not a viable

strategy so what do you do that's the

real question right what do I do I

understand what's going on

well by acknowledging that this is sort

of a destructive interruptive

um bully style Behavior I think you

start to see some steps that you're

gonna want to try to take so first of

all use the tribunal method tribunal is

super valuable and it's a very simple

social

structure to use and this is just

assemble your your group away from the

game table you know maybe over a

cheeseburger or a beer or coffee

and just open the table to say hey what

do you guys like and what do you dislike

about the game now if this low

intelligence problem doesn't come up

then it's up to you to have the honesty

to bring it up and say well there's this

one thing about this character it's kind

of bringing me down it's kind of

wrecking my fun a little bit is that

bugging you guys because it's a little

bit of a bummer you know nothing against

you Carl or whatever whatever the

player's name is

but I just don't think maybe you intend

it and it's kind of wrecking my fun okay

and then you can talk it out okay that's

the first step and that's the easy one

if that doesn't work

then you're getting into some more

difficult social terrain and that could

involve two common techniques out there

negotiator techniques one is diffusion

and the other is privacy

diffusion is basically the art of never

escalating a conflict socially

but to being brutally totally honest

about your feelings and bringing those

to the table

and diffusing what is usually desired by

disruptive people like this is that what

they want is conflict they actually want

the attention involved with their

disruption and you can often diffuse it

by accepting it opening up about it

getting it out right on the table in

front and that's often very

uncomfortable for this bully type

um

personality and so that's diffusion

diffusion is just not escalating the

conflict but just being fine and kind of

rocking on and putting it out in the

open

privacy is almost the opposite privacy

is you you see this on TV shows a lot

they say may I have a word with you

alone

no one does that in real life like ever

unless you like work for the FBI or

something it is extremely awkward and

difficult to ask someone can we go have

a word in private that is so weird but

if you really want this person in your

game you don't want to switch your game

group you want to follow through with

this campaign you want it to work out

you might have to confront this most

difficult level this is taking a

disruptive player aside in private so

that they're not you know being called

out in front of others and then going

back to the exact same thing you said at

tribunal dude it's kind of wrecking my

fun and honestly I've kind of taking it

a little bit personal that you're sort

of playing this this sort of dumb card

to kind of wreck the the mood and the

fun of the of the group

like can that change a little bit like

you know I want this group to work out

I'm having fun with it

you can also try this in text it's a lot

less effective but you can try it in

text if you guys have a game group

thread that you run on Facebook so I

know none of those answers are easy but

that's all I can offer you the character

is not the problem low intelligence

characters are great

it's disruptive players and and this is

actually one step lower than a worse

problem which is disruptive players who

use character traits as an excuse like

they make hateful or racist or nasty or

sadistic characters and they blame the

character for these behaviors that they

want to exhibit personally that's that's

even tougher that can be socially

complex and uh sometimes in those cases

you're you're best off trying to reform

the group without that player

because you don't need all that

frustration you're just here to have fun

this isn't a job

so I hope that helps uh with the

question and you know disruptive players

are always difficult and uh you know

Cody from uh take 20 taking 20 on

YouTube actually has a funny video about

tabletop drama

um which is really constructive it's all

about setting expectations and being

upfront and being honest and you know

the advice is going to sound similar

across several channels for dealing with

these kind of situations so good luck

and I hope that helped

okay our second letter for mailbag day

today I'm rummaging around in the

mailbag here

um we have got a challenge where a

character story has actually become more

Central in the players Minds than the

dungeon Masters intended story

so the the specifics here is that they

have a dwarf in their group who's kind

of set his mind to rebelling against the

current Dwarven King and becoming King

himself

now especially if that Dwarven King is

sort of a tyrant this is a fantastic

storyline that can drive a lot of

different subplots and and you know

miniature episodes right this is really

fun with a player coming to the table

with this much like directed desire oh

man you can mine that desire you can you

can lure him with it and then you can

take it away and like oh man it's just

great

the problem is the dungeon master had

this other big storyline and really no

one cares about it and this sort of

rebellion against the king thing is

taking Center Stage

and also the player is sort of walking

around sort of talking down to NPCs like

he's already the king

so this dungeon master is feeling a

little out in the cold on the whole

thing so what do you do

my advice on this one uh extends to a

lot of different games and a lot of

different uh troubles with story and

that is and I know this is gonna sound

tough but forget about your dungeon

master story

just forget about it it doesn't matter

it just completely let it go now you can

have a cool little you know maybe it's

gonna come up someday but just let it go

take what drives players and run with it

just accept that

if they have this goal and this desire

and they want to be something Just Go

With It just lean in

now that's a separate solution then to

the he already thinks he's King and he's

kind of talking down to NPCs okay that

is a different problem and the world the

fictional world needs to respond to him

if he is talking [ __ ] so to speak

then the world needs to say dude you're

not King we're gonna throw you in jail

and oh look here comes the elite guard

they've heard rumors that you've been

telling people you're the king like this

is this is basically treason

if you don't have those ramifications

repercussions for this kind of flippant

behavior in your world then yeah players

are ambitious players can be big-minded

and they will walk all over you but you

gotta stand your ground always be

magnanimous be generous but don't be

pushed around either as the dungeon

master you you are the king in a way

now you have this meta knowledge that

this character wants to usurp your

throne

but as a player who's playing the king

himself

I mean you need to show some some sand

on this issue you can't have people

walking around saying this kind of stuff

so there needed to be repercussions for

this group but the tougher answer that I

want everybody to take away from this

particular piece of mail is if you do

have really strong character stories

and especially if you can see ways that

they can unfold in fun ways that lead to

honor and Valor and friendship and

fellowship and love then lean in and

forget about the other story that you

wrote try it another time or just leave

it on the in the vault Shelf

but having players that are already

bringing story to the table is what

you've been dreaming of as a dungeon

master not a problem so I know it's a

bit of a tough uh sort of a hard-nosed

answer but just go for it and uh

hopefully it turns out great

all right on a related issue and the

reason I chose these three letters today

is they all are kind of somewhat related

we have a frustrated dungeon master who

he has

some players that I don't want to use

the word murder hobo because I think

it's become so common and funny that it

no longer has any gravity

his players have committed a mass murder

and really for no reason they just

wanted a boat

and they basically wiped out a fishing

Village

and this is making it hard for him to

maintain tone in his game

and to have

you know gravity to NPCs and you know

basically all the tools that a dungeon

master has if you just have mass

murderers walking around it can be

extremely difficult to do anything

poetic or nuanced right very common

problem in d d and it's really really

sad problem because to me it reflects

total flippancy on the side of the

players especially if they're all doing

it as a group and no one cares that it's

basically just burning this world to the

ground and just these are all innocent

people and then the the dungeon master

starts to have a hard time providing

moral motivation for these types of

sadistic

scum basically they're they're

Scoundrels they're

they're awful they're villains

what do you do

my advice here if you want to keep the

group together and you don't want to

just scrap the campaign because if it

were me I would just I think I would

probably scrap it I can't stand this

kind of behavior I think it's reflecting

of a deeper sociological and

psychological phenomenon that I don't

want to be around at all

but barring that solution I think what

you need is you can imagine these

players as kind of like three-year-old

kids running around in your kitchen

breaking dishes okay let's use that

analogy They're Gonna Keep on doing that

until they are informed that there are

consequences so this three-year-old kid

if every time he breaks a dish he has to

go sit in his room by himself for half

an hour well very quickly they're going

to change now that is a substitute for

True morality but

if you're not even getting an inkling of

morality you're gonna have to accept a

substitute as a starting point so this

is my advice is you have to put

ramifications on these heinous acts

so these guys decimated a fishing

Village right they killed all these

innocent people who are just trying to

make a living by this this Lake

there is an Avenger

and the Avenger is is sent by The King

by royalty or even by Heaven itself

to avenge these innocent souls and this

dude or group is nasty I'm talking 10

times the level of the players

with

an arsenal of spells and different

immunities and anti-magic field and this

guy brings it now it's not just you just

got killed by a story hook don't do that

that's not cool you have to play Within

the rules but you can make a monster who

is sent

by The Souls of these innocent people

that were slain to

lay low the characters and that means

destroy their gear

and kill or jail them

probably jail them killing them ends the

story and that's not that fun right so

he's here to jail them and destroy their

equipment

but when you roll up with this Avenger

you have to be firm and have a very

bright heart so you still gotta these

are your friends remember you still have

to love the game and the fun of the

Avenger

but as a game designer you are dropping

the Dark Souls hammer on these guys but

make it fun keep your attitude bright

there's still going to be a lot of

laughter at the table

but man this Avenger he brings the pain

now let's say that they defeat the

Avenger or the Avenger sort of loses

some of his will to Smite the characters

because the lesson is starting to get

learned that's good and then he says I'm

watching you from now on

I've been assigned to you and you will

conjure me with your evil Deeds

now is it a little heavy-handed hell

yeah it's heavy-handed I mean the

players are going to see right through

what you're doing but at this point you

have players who don't care

if things are heavy-handed they just

slaughtered a village to take a rowboat

so you're not in a place where nuance

and story gently guiding the story is

going to effectively steer these guys

away from Pure Evil

so that's my advice bring the Avenger

so that is mailbag day for today and

let's hear that lovely music to take us

out of here

[Music]

mail back there mail back day let's go

see what's in the mail today

okay so our final piece for uh RPG talks

episode one

is uh inspired by and designed by you

guys now the idea uh in our thread that

we were running as many of you know

wants to do as part of RPG talks uh how

to run a blank

type talk so this was inspired by the

dragon video that's over on drunken

dragons

um which basically was just the direct

result of me running several Dragon

encounters uh in our game

and I think it's a it's a fun idea it's

a very direct to your table idea so

keeping things relevant with what I've

been running very recently

let's talk about how to run a Caster

boss

now this could also be very relevant

because what we were just talking about

about the Avenger right this is going to

need to be a Caster boss and what what

is the Caster boss exactly well you guys

probably know this is when you realize

that throwing uh 30 more orc Warriors at

your group is not going to work they've

learned how to use AOE they learn how to

use the environment they they can defeat

huge groups of goblins or ghouls or

whites or nulls right

and what you want is a new different

feeling encounter that's tough that's

deadly that challenges their brains and

challenges their stats besides like

sword sword sword battle ax sword shield

right

so how do you portray this Caster

villain

and more uh more to the to the

discussion how do you mechanically run

this Caster villain

in a way that kicks ass and is memorable

and is dangerous and is fun

I got three ideas on this that I'd like

you guys to consider

the first one is sort of the Standalone

right there's not 20 of these guys

there's one and this is exciting for the

encounter two is lots of movement you've

got to have a lot of movement tank and

spank on a Caster is not fun it's not

really much fun on anything much less a

caster

and then finally flexible Magic

keep your magic flexible and this is

probably my biggest piece of advice is

this flexible magic tip so let's get

through the easier ones first

all right to stand alone when they meet

this enemy he is up on a a rocky

Promontory or Crag he's in a ruined

Fortress he's in a Sanctum sanctorum

right and and this tone is important

because it's kind of like oh this is

just one dude that that's the tone you

want to create this is we've fought

armies before this is just one guy

what's the big deal

and then he teleports up to the top of

the tower and casts lightning bolt you

see what I mean like

you need to set this tone I I am one I

am many I am all things that's the

attitude of this Caster this guy is

gnarly or this girl this creature this

thing

doesn't need an army now if you want to

have this Caster summon additional

monsters as Potter or something that's

fine but the mood should be this loner

mood they they encounter this kind of

whoa there's one of them

now a smarter player will be like this

is bad this is bad there's only one of

them that's not good right and so you

want to bring that tone okay so so try

that and it's going to make your life

easier too to just have the one you can

focus okay I need to keep this guy from

dying right I need to keep him moving so

they can't pin him down I need to make

sure that he has maybe two or even three

actions per turn so he can take on all

group

I need to know how his spells can

combine and you basically can just work

into this one character and make him a

one man or one woman

magical fighting machine

okay step two lots of movement

nothing kills a boss fight more than

just having the players closing around

it and just termite their way through

the hit points and their hit points are

going down and the boss's hit points are

going down and then he holds his throat

and falls over and dies that it may be

dangerous it may be a close race but

really it's just a hit point race and

like there's just no your board isn't

really playing a role by board I mean

your Terrain

so you want movement happening so make

sure when you're designing this guy uh

that this Mage villain

can blip can can teleport can

translocate maybe uses runes on the

ground and at those locations he could

appear at any one of these locations

maybe he can self-clone and only one of

them is real and that's how he moves

maybe he's just insanely fast maybe he

can fly and flying makes it hard to pin

him down either way you want to move

your characters around the board another

way to do it is to plant bombs so if

your Caster can plant bombs this will

cause everyone to run away and move then

you can go to a new location plan a bomb

there everyone has to run away and

repeat repeat repeat

another one with flight is if your

Caster villain can fly up completely out

of range but sort of like vermothrax and

dragon slayer he goes up there's sort of

a pause of tension and a few moments

later he comes thundering back down on

the attack

and how long is that Gap and can the

players learn the the sort of the

pattern so that they can be ready for

his next sort of swoop quote unquote

this is very common in dragon battles

so the movement just keeps your players

jumping around the board that's the key

you can do it in numerous ways but

remember this villain can break a lot of

rules and it's okay

this villain kind of blows the

character's minds of what's possible in

this world including things like

teleportation

finally the most fascinating aspect of

Designing and running your Caster

villain

is going to be exactly how you use and

execute his arsenal of spells in battle

now my advice goes right into episode 2

of RPG talks which is all about making

spells easier to use in play but

basically what you're going to need is a

nice big group of spells you don't want

to be doing the same two or three spells

over and over because it starts to

become very unbelievable it starts to

feel very weird you know magic Missile

magic Missile magic Missile magic

Missile just like this is I don't know

so it's more like if you have eight

spells you get one or two uses each

and those spells need to be notated for

your boss in a single line of text you

need really simple descriptions of what

these spells do so that you can choose

and use very quickly

you don't want to slow the game down

with your Caster boss

and remember he might have three actions

per turn so you're casting three spells

sometimes teleport Arcane bomb and

lightning bolt

right then teleport Fireball and

concussive wave

then teleport

dominate monster and concussive wave you

see what I'm saying and you can even

write those flows down if you don't want

to decide on the fly during your game

but I I advise that you do it on the Fly

because you never know what players are

going to do and you want to use those

spells to affect you want to knock

players off cliffs you want to trap

players in Corners with a bomb you want

a lightning bolt characters with metal

armor you wanna you wanna use things to

their fullest remember this is a boss be

merciless with how your magic combines

another one could be a spike if we're

talking 5e could be Spike growth and

teleport out so he leaves an area of

spikes behind he teleports then they

need to run to go fight him and if you

guys know about Spike growth it's like a

cheese grater when you move across it

you take a bunch of damage so he he's

kiting the players

and kiting players with a boss is not a

simple thing to execute as a dungeon

master but if you're ruthless and if you

look to the Spells as your guide for the

theme and the flow of how the fight's

gonna go

you'll find it easier to come up with

some of these power strategies

especially if you don't use all your

time looking up spells

just invent them

looking up spells is for players you're

a dungeon master you can invent spells

that fit your character I mean look at

like the witch king of angmar or Gandalf

right they have these kind of crazy kind

of spells and magic powers that don't

really fit what the other characters are

limited to and that makes it cool

so through making this sort of more

simple more flexible easy to use magic

system not worrying about slots and

charges and all this kind of stuff you

can rip through it quicker and the fun

is going to be where it should be which

is on player turns

and just be deadly don't hold back just

go for it

so I hope that helps with how to run a

if you guys want to see some examples of

um spellcaster bosses on my YouTube

channel you can always look for the

final boss encounter in um

the in the moloch series

um also I did have some spell casting

with my twin Dragons uh battle and then

the huge one which was uh Anvil Tower

um that was where they battled South the

character from Dungeons and Dragons who

was actually one of the few uh monsters

that my party that particular party ever

fled from in the entire campaign I think

they're about level eight and they just

had to flee and that had never happened

before so in my mind that was a fun

outcome because our Escape what was what

was so exciting it wasn't just killing

him or just being killed by him it was

the action excitement of the Escape was

really cool

so I hope that helps if you're designing

your next Caster boss and we're coming

up here on the end of RPG talks episode

one so thanks everybody for tuning in

it's really fun to bring this kind of

thinking on over to patreon thank you so

okay so um

oh what's that creaking noise

creature at my doorway anyway

RPG talks this is uh episode five I do

believe and we are going to go into the

uh the sort of runner-up or number two

spot on you guys's Poll for you know

what would make a good talk what makes

good listening you're cruising Along on

your commute you know the other cars

they're they're coming and going they're

going too slow they're merging poorly

they're putting on their signal too late

or too early

and you're just looking for something to

you know get your mind off of this

business and think back into RPG land

where everything's cool so what we're

going to talk about today is the sacred

the sanctified

the solid oh wait it's not solid

the secret it's not a secret either

the stupendous

GM's oath the oath of the dungeon master

really is what it's called now

technically dungeon master is

uh a term that apparently has trademark

issues around it which is really

disappointing to me really disappointing

they should just let that go it's over

but

for the sake of this podcast we can call

it the oath of the dungeon master now in

print I'm gonna have to call it the game

Masters oath but uh it truly is an oath

of dungeon Masters now if you guys are

reading along in your wooden Pew out

there in the uh in the Church of index

card RPG please open your texts to page

58.

the the oath of the dungeon master was

uh a piece of writing that I've been

working on for a long time as many of

you know it started in uh another

project called The Deadly architect now

originally the deadly architect was

going to be an entire book devoted just

to the art of being a dungeon master

what I started realizing in time is that

without a game for more context namely a

system and a a tone a mood trying to

define the art of the dungeon master

became very general and and I did not

like that you know how I am with

generalization I'm not a fan I like to

be very very specific so the deadly

architect sat in cold storage for more

than a year

um and then as icrpg was coming together

that awesome oath was back in the back

of my head and it needed to find its way

into the book

the oath of the dungeon master okay so

it finally found its way into a book and

found its way out to a lot of people and

uh

you know in some ways

yeah it's just sort of motivational

generalization it's just inspiring words

there isn't like this shocking lightning

bolt of content that's going to change

your game tomorrow night

but a lot of people got back to me after

reading the book and saying this was one

of their favorite little pieces and

maybe it's just because it brought into

Focus thoughts that they've been having

for years

or thoughts that they were hoping to

hear from an outside voice that would

serve as an affirmation you know I think

just the limbic system of the dungeon

master responds well

to the stanzas or the the sections or

the the lines of the dungeon Masters

oath so the purpose of today's RPG talk

is can sort of going deeper into each

one of the lines

um there's I think what nine lines to it

and uh

each one of course has a little blurb in

the book so I'm not just going to repeat

the blurb in the book I just wanted to

give you my thoughts where each line

came from and maybe ways that you can

take it further in your game because

we're always looking for ways to take

our game just a little bit further or

maybe we're we're cooked and we're

burned out or maybe we're about to start

a new group or hoping to find a new

group and look for that tone there's so

many different phases of RPG life I've

been really realizing that a great deal

lately as I'm starting to think about

pulling a table group back together

again and maybe even making like a

weekly group in a neutral location and

podcasting it and really kind of going

for it to do a big campaign and when you

start thinking that way you want to up

your game you know how can I improve and

where and why and so on and so forth so

the very first premise

of the dungeon Masters oath I will let

the torrent flow

I will let the torrent flow now the most

key element of this part of the oath and

why you vow this to yourself

it's not saying I'm gonna do a bunch of

stuff I'm going to be a flood of ideas

I'm gonna I'm just gonna keep going all

the time that's not the point really of

the torrent it's letting the torrent

flow it's it's un allowing

it's like the Zen mind beginner's mind

thoughts come and thoughts go your only

job is to make no Ado of it to let it

happen

the torrent is already happening inside

your head otherwise you wouldn't even be

listening to this

um what is this thing is this a podcast

the torrent's already happening you're

already interested in a bunch of things

you already want a bunch of things

you're you're reaching

your your craving that is the torrent

The letting part the allowing part is to

Simply remove your judgmental mind your

adult mind your big mind

and let that small mind that just wants

a thing to happen just take the driver's

seat and I think very often because our

our hobby can be complicated this step

is very easy to say you know just let it

happen guys just write down whatever

pops in your head boy uh thanks a lot

hanker and that's really useful oh

the real lesson is actually much more

difficult to fully absorb and that's

because our minds are so cluttered with

so many things and they range from the

totally banal and unrelated

everyday concerns that guy's turn signal

what am I going to have for lunch one of

my shoelaces is untied all the way over

to nuanced and complex thoughts about

well this time around I want to make a

campaign that's really going to make you

know that one player you know Sally get

excited and really show up to the table

each week and I want to craft the story

in a way that it's not just about her

but it pulls her in okay how can I do

well that's a that is a complex and

nuanced desire

to not only fulfill

these surface mind issues the monkey

mind as some of the Zen Masters have

called it because it's so active and so

Wiggly

to satisfy that part of the mind but

then also to allow the little mind to

just write down the word barbarian

because I think barbarians are cool what

does that mean for my campaign I have no

idea but to write it down is the first

step in saying to yourself that little

mind matters

that silly unplanned

poorly thought out little impulse mind

matters and I'm going to document it

okay I've been doing that for half an

hour now I have a bunch of unrelated

words here time for the old left brain

to kick in and do some hard work

but that letting the torrent flow the

key word in that piece of the oath is

the word let to allow to take your

defenses down to take your judgment down

let yourself be imaginative let yourself

be silly let yourself be serious

and find there in that little mind those

things that have kept you coming back to

this Hobby

again and again

the second one is a much more nuts and

bolts type item I will remember

everything

I will remember everything

now this is a sort of a call to action

to dungeon Masters out there this is

asking more of you

and since the oath is something that you

say to yourself this is something you're

asking of yourself this is something

you're vowing unto yourself no one's

going to check you on this you will not

be graded on this quiz

only you will ever really know

your players will also know a little bit

because they'll get that moment of

delight of thinking that a thing was

gone but there it is

one of the Modern Masters of this skill

has got to be Matt Mercer now I don't

know if he has assistance helping him

with bullet notes or if he's just

brilliant

probably a little bit of both Maybe

but the way that details in their

campaign Rose and fell and then were

renewed and came back at the moment you

didn't expect

was brilliant and this is what the oath

is asking of you now is to remember all

the details

now that doesn't mean write everything

down because to write a thing down and

to remember a thing are very different

activities when you write a thing down

it becomes somewhat static it becomes

part of an ever-growing Sheaf of piles

of reams of papers and notes and bullet

points but when you remember it's on

call it's there it's ready in the moment

and this applies to character details

historical events detailed things that

happened in the campaign snacks that

were brought rule nuances

spell descriptions class progression XP

values challenge ratings legendary

actions

this is everything in the wide sense of

the term everything about your game and

your hobby you're going to retain now

okay that is a nice high-minded ideal

right that sounds fantastic I totally

want to be that way

man hankering

sounds great there's one problem

I don't remember everything okay so now

you're going to get into the challenging

area of using mnemonic tools to actually

improve how smart you are and how well

you retain information now everyone

learns and retains differently some

people are right down remembers

Sometimes some people are audio

remembers they hear a thing and it just

pops right into their memory for good

other people can see a thing or read a

thing and it will go into their memory I

can't tell you the best technique to use

but what I can do

is invite you to look into it take a

look into what mnemonic devices are take

a look into what ones have proven to be

the most successful over the decades

because some definitely rise above

others and then do some experiments with

yourself of the way that you learn use

this knowledge to make your game better

for me it's definitely bullet listing

when I bullet list things I just

remember them I almost never have to

look back at the bullet list but I I

have to bullet list that in a certain

way and in a certain environment I can't

have other stimulus happening

I usually this may sound silly but I

like to have a cold beer sitting right

there by me it's almost like a an

affectation I think is the word it's

it's a device

it isn't that drinking a bunch of beer

makes me remember things because I think

that's probably ludicrous but having it

there it's like Linus's blanket it's a

focal point for my intellect and it

helps me to access those parts of my

mind

that more accurately and readily absorb

and retain information

so take a look in your own life and your

own habits and find those mnemonic

devices use them and as the oath

proclaims

remember everything

I will build a world from their actions

this is a doozy you know what's really

fun when you're a dungeon master sitting

down creating a whole world and a whole

campaign and a whole story arc and then

oops

you're a novelist

a dungeon master has no idea what's

going to happen a good one

you don't have to create a sandbox world

like Super Mario 2 or something where

they can go anywhere they you don't have

to create Skyrim you don't have to

create red dead right

what you do need is a good night of fun

that has some open-ended options be they

overt or

sort of innate in the adventure implied

or overt

and then players will choose those

through their actions and their

preferences of dreams and ambitions

your job is the dungeon master then

is to take this and say oh you know what

that could mean

this guy over here isn't a guy at all

he's like some kind of Seraph from

ancient times who's come to avenge the

hippity-dippity of the dibbity doo okay

then off you go to the races right

creating a world from their actions

means you don't get to make the whole

thing you get to make a little piece

then you get to see what they do scratch

your chin back on your own time

and make more you don't have to have

each session be this wild spaghetti of

choices going all new directions but

between sessions you are building that

world based on what they assumed what

they dream of what they did and what

they didn't do what they left undone and

had no interest in what they want to

avenge

probably the biggest question in

building your campaign is you guys know

how this goes toward the end of an

adventure whether it's still sort of an

official table time or like as you guys

are snacking and packing up your gear

and heading home the DM will also always

ask you know so what do you guys think

like next time do you think you're going

to take the stage coach up to the

mountain or like you want to head over

to the glacier or do you guys have

something else in mind and then there's

a quick convo glittery

now if you're clever the players will

not think much of what they say in that

moment but you're listening at your

utmost attentiveness and this the minute

they're all out of the door you're

bulleting down what they said then walk

away and tomorrow you can start to think

about how to worldify

those statements

but to take this part of the oath

seriously you really have to accept the

challenge of not making your whole

campaign in one sweeping wondrous Arc

behold my genius that's not part of the

oath

behold my storytelling as I create this

entire sandbox world now you can go

anywhere in it and have no impact on it

because it's already written

not cool bro or at least not as cool as

it could be

and that's what the oath is all about

seeing the best path

and then using it as an affirmation like

Bruce Lee said I imagine myself as the

student hearing my own voice as that of

the teacher

and this is a an internal dialogue

method that lets you say high-minded

things to yourself without proclaiming

that you already have mastered those

things

it lets you talk to yourself in your

smartest biggest voice

without feeling pompous basically

use that inner teacher voice use the

inner student and keep working toward

the dream of building an entire world

from a set of player actions

boy this next one is very nuts and bolds

fee very very practical very down to

earth I will be an architect now I

didn't even mean this in any

metaphorical sense I literally am saying

study architecture

like there's no there's very little

hidden depth here

take a look at at least like the wiki on

the basics of architecture or

environmental design either one is fine

they both have tons of things to educate

you about how space can be used to

induce reaction and to induce emotion in

people even if you do complete theater

of the Mind actually more so

if you do theater of the Mind are you

going to need the skill of architecture

you guys have probably seen this one

product out there called Anonymous or

not Anonymous um anomalous underground

space or dwelling or something like that

right and it's basically a pun on the

fact that dungeons make no sense they're

like these one-way tunnels that go

nowhere that have all these twists and

turns for no reason right and it's kind

of funny on that

now you're definitely going to go a long

way with anomalous underground dwellings

but if you have some of the more

architectural unities on your side

you're going to go much further and

these unities include things like

symmetry

they include things like indirect eye

lines

and and the contrast between large and

small spaces to create Sensations

the use of vertical versus horizontal

the use of High versus low and so on and

so forth and what these mean to people

and players won't know what their limbic

system has to say about architectural

unities

but over time you will see that this

really matters if if there's one huge

one that I can offer I'd say it would be

symmetry if you walk into a door on one

side of a structure or space you expect

there to be a door in a similar or exact

same location on the far side

if it's there

you get this feeling of reward it's a

nice feeling it's the opposite of that

feeling like walking through you know a

department store where they put the

doors in random places to get you to

squiggle through the space to shop more

I hate that

now your players may not perceive it in

such tangible fashion as you do when

you're in the mall but believe me those

Sensations are still there so be an

architect look into it what is

architecture why is it fascinating

a lot of what dungeon mastering is is

architecture now of course there are

other more nuanced dimensions

lots of them

but this point in the oath is very

simple very practical and very literal I

will be an architect

now on the exact opposite end of the

spectrum

the architect is the Vulcan right

the next item is I will be poetic

now not many modern thinkers would draw

many parallels between the art of Being

poetic and the art of Being

architectural

but in Aristotle's time these two things

went together hand in hand and they go

hand in hand for you too because you are

a dungeon master you are taking the oath

to be poetic means to see

gravity

to see Redemption

to see

morality to see dilemma

to see Agony to see wrath to see lust

in the details and not only to see it

but then to manifest it and not be

scared

being poetic is super embarrassing you

guys in daily life being poetic is super

weird I know because I do it too often

and it's weird

now I know that I've built a sort of a

reputation around myself for saying

poetic things and having poetic feelings

and being very honest about them right

but that is not an easy reputation to

build

being poetic means openly displaying

emotion and also seeing it and seeds of

it in small places and and openly

uh nurturing or cultivating the

emotional impact of words and actions

and how they Interlock in human emotion

and you as the dungeon master need the

courage

to be honest about those emotions and

honest about displaying them

d d can wear very thin if you if you

don't have emotion

you find yourself in like gag one shots

right or endless combat that just feels

like slogging

poetry is the moment that a thing that

happened is related to another one and

what seemed lost is found again

or what seemed found

is now lost

it's also letting things sink in

I've noticed recently that in a lot of

games

both dungeon Masters and players are

spending a lot of time describing

and they're usually describing things

that are just literal and I would also

use this as a critique against a lot of

fantasy novelists that I've been reading

recently they they describe literal

events to me the guy pried opened the

door and man when he did oh that lock

popped right off there and the door flew

open and whoa he stabbed that guy so

hard the guy's eyeballs popped out and

then fell down

I shot this guy right in the neck and

the back of his neck popped out and went

all over the wall let me tell you what

right

all this time being used on the literal

description of nuts and boltsy events

could be far better used

to describe emotion but the raw truth of

it is that this is very difficult to do

it can be embarrassing it can feel

awkward

and it can be the absolute antipathy or

the furthest reach

of role-playing

everyone does a funny accent

and everyone makes choices in the action

scenes that fit their characters right

those are the fundamentals of

role-playing but the outer edges of

role-playing are actually feeling the

emotions being poetic inside your

character

hoping for what your character hopes for

and feeling tragedy when your character

experiences tragedy and you as a dungeon

master once again have to be a beacon to

create a safe environment for people to

feel these Sensations and not feel silly

and not feel weird have you guys have

probably heard my whole talk about

Dorking right the DM has a

responsibility to be the biggest dork at

the table

if you're the biggest dork you're the

most enthusiastic the most socially

awkward everyone else looks cool

and they feel safe to really dork out

over the game

because man the DM is just his mind is

just exploding thinking about you

reaching fourth level and all these new

spell options you're gonna have oh my

God we're just gonna sit we're just

gonna shop for spells for hours it's

gonna be so cool now suddenly you are

like well I was just gonna pick a couple

and move on you feel all cool all of a

sudden and it's the same with being

poetic as the dungeon master if you set

the tone as a poetic tone as an

emotionally open tone everyone at the

table doesn't have to be at that level

but they can feel safe being at their

level

and that's why this one is so nuanced

and so important

to the deeper Realms of dungeon

mastering

and it's going to be difficult in a one

shot I'm just gonna come right out there

and say it's gonna be hard one shots

have a lot of action they have a lot of

sort of Shaving a haircut kind of feel

to them and it's hard to build enough

context to feel this stuff but in a two

three or more session campaign the the

seeds are going to be growing and it's

up to you to cultivate them so be poetic

now the next one I've never had any

trouble with but I have had both players

and dungeon Masters who have a heck of a

time with this one and the the oath

piece here is I will be energetic

I will be energetic I will show up ready

to jam

I can barely control myself I'm so

excited to do a recap of the last

session so we can get into this now a

great example of someone who is like

ridiculously energetic about d d is Matt

Colville this guy can barely keep

himself from Talking a million miles an

hour because you can tell he's just

enthusiastic about the crap that went

down or his new idea about how to play

Undead he just he's just ripping through

it

a lot of dungeon Masters and players

show up to this game in a sort of a

median level of energy

not like you know hey okay well last

time we do okay that's an extreme case

right no need to give that guy a hard

time he's he probably just ran over his

dog or something but you know what I

mean by median level okay it's just sort

of an even level like this and um we're

gonna play some DND tonight and uh last

session I'm pretty sure the ranger got

killed and uh there's a tentacle that is

on the ship and um yeah what do you guys

want to do

that's not energetic

and you don't have to be a spaz all the

time but what you do need is excitement

you need to honestly be approaching the

game like yes I'm here time to play now

it doesn't have to last every second it

doesn't have to be in every word you say

you don't have to wave your arms like a

madman or mad woman

[Laughter]

that energy is clutch if you need a Red

Bull drink it if you need a cup of

coffee hit it you're that five or Five

Hour Energy weirdo or you need to go for

a jog or whatever then you do it but you

use whatever tool you need to especially

in the first hour

to be super attentive to be high energy

to be

gestural to be vocal to be excited

just like poetry

the energy level of the table is going

to Riff on your energy level if it's low

people are on their phones in the first

10 minutes

if it's high you could probably get them

through a couple hours before they're on

their phone

this one doesn't really need a lot of

whipping to it it's extremely literal

extremely simple and very very easy to

do you don't need to change the way you

think you don't need to become smarter

you don't need any of this stuff you

don't need to learn anything to be

energetic all you need to do is Rally

rally up bring yourself to the table and

show the hell up I don't care how tired

you are set your tired aside and show up

and have fun

this next one pretty weird

this next one's tough I will lift them

up and I will vanish

being a player's biggest fan has always

been a staple of many you know writings

about how to be a good dungeon master

you're a fan of the players you love

their characters and you want to see

them win right

you want to see Michael Knight beat the

Oddball bad guys when you're watching

Knight Rider because you think Michael

Knight is cool and you have that same

feeling about your players characters

and your players themselves you want

them to win because woo

but here's the thing

when it comes time to really reap the

glory for who's the coolest at the table

it cannot be you it has to be them and

this is an ongoing skill that you're

going to have to learn the biggest way

you can break this rule is by making an

NPC who is cooler than the players

characters classic Mistake by a dungeon

master

you meet this guy and he's actually like

a six level spellcaster and he says he's

going to help with the mission and then

he starts casting like all these badass

spells that your second level wizard

can't do oh boy

you are not lifting them up and you are

definitely not Vanishing

all of your actions should not only

reaffirm the player's characters are

some of the very coolest people in this

world except maybe some of the Epic

villains right

but also it's not because of you that

they're cool and I'm speaking about the

dungeon master it's because of them

they made their player cool it's not

because this world happens to be weaker

than them because the dungeon master

made it that way no it's because the way

the player is executing his hero makes

them cooler than the NPCs makes them

cooler than the enemies or even the

villains now how do you do this it's the

way that player and character actions

impact your world and who reaps the

glory which is them

this is letting player agency be the

coolest thing in a session if you have a

high damage say environmental hazard

that's fine be brutal with your high

damage environmental hazard but don't

talk about it a bunch it just delivers

its damage and moves on you don't

describe in great detail these rocks and

how they fell on the player's heads no

your description your time and your

enthusiasm go into how the characters

respond even when they're crushed by the

rocks how they're heroic

how a lesser man would already be dead

but not you you just took 14 damage you

still have two hit points left and

you're back in the fight because you're

a hero not man did you see how cool that

was that my rocks fell and just crushed

the hell out of you

[Laughter]

so not only are you lifting them up

you're also removing yourself from the

equation as the dungeon master making

sure that they

are the ones invested if you're a

dungeon master you're already so into

this Hobby in this game you do not need

any encouragement

I mean except being a human being you're

definitely going to want some love right

everybody wants a little bit love

but I mean at a session you're one of

your goals is to make players remember

man do I want to play again next week

because they'll come they'll have more

fun they'll role play better they'll

have better details that everything will

be cooler and your dungeon Master's

dream which I bet you guys know what I'm

talking about will be closer to coming

true

the way you visualize the game and dream

about the game being will be closer

the more excited the players are so lift

them up

and vanish

the next one is not only a skill of

dungeon mastering but in life

and that is I will be a beacon of

camaraderie

this can be hard sometimes

this can be very hard there are parts of

our hobby that can be solitary

you know when you're crafting your

writing I'm in one of those phases right

now

I'm in the solo phase I mean partially

I'm just

you know up to my neck in stuff you know

I'm doing a lot of commissions and I'm

trying to get another book out and doing

some game design and doing all this

stuff and so I'm in the solitary mode

but

once a game is engaged

just like the Dorking just like being

poetic just like being energetic you

want to make friends better friends

you want to raise toasts you want to

remind each other man I love it when we

hang out together you guys make me feel

cool you know that I'm just gonna be

cheesy and come right out and say it I

don't care what do I have to lose

hey I can't wait to see you guys this

week it's gonna be awesome

you know I like it when you come over to

my house because then I have food

you guys I've gotten a confession I did

not clean the bathroom for the session

this week

so you're going to be looking at last

week's poop because

by the way the toilet doesn't work

either

okay it took five episodes of RPG talks

to reach bathroom humor anyways you guys

get what I'm saying it's it's just like

being poetic it's having the nerve to

come out in the open and say you guys

are cool

I like you guys you're my friends and I

ever tell you that

now usually alcohol is your buddy when

it comes to saying this kind of stuff

because Modern Life has not really uh

prepared or trained us to be honest

about fellowship and about friendship

and about openly stating

you guys are great man or if if two

people aren't getting along to mending

that fence and to bringing them together

to always seeing the positive always

wanting to bring the group together

knowing that the context of each person

and what they're going through in you

know IRL and so on and so forth and what

what it means for the game and and to be

accommodating of it and also encouraging

and also demanding to ask that they push

themselves

it's one of my favorite features in a

good friend

is that they push me to rise up to my

ultimate self but they also totally

understand what I'm going through and

give me a little bit of space that you

are doing all these things as the

dungeon master

this is tough man there's a lot of stuff

to do all of a sudden

but you only have to do the things in

the oath if you're reaching for the

highest levels

and being a beacon of camaraderie is a

huge element of reaching to the highest

level it's always reminding each other

they love each other always reminding

them that you love them

go in for the hug man go in for the hug

finally

and this is I think actually one of the

most um

sort of

gagged on elements and I don't mean like

I mean there's a lot of gags about it

the most joked about the most memed

element of being a dungeon master which

is I will be a terror to behold

you know in almost everything you see

online the dungeon master is portrayed

as this sadistic math freak who's out to

make you know players cry and tear up

their character sheets or burn their

character sheets or like this whole dumb

myth about how dungeon Masters enjoy

killing players and how you oh man I

wonder if we're going to be able to

survive tonight because the dungeon

Masters got that Wicked grin on his face

right right this is a really common

sort of stereotype of what a dungeon

master is is this kind of socially

maladjusted super nerd who gets some

kind of Twisted pleasure out of undoing

other people's work in the game

well for the sake of this part of the

oath

that is exactly what you're gonna do

now I am totally not a believer in stuff

like Tearing Up character sheets and

like reveling in character death I I

don't no I can't that's not part of my

game it never will be

I do not see that as good I think I see

that as DM bullying really

but

I'll sure as hell kill your character

and I will bring the tools I have to the

table to make this business deadly

I will have devious secrets

and when you learn them you will shudder

I will reveal things that you don't want

to be revealed I will take you down

tunnels that you didn't want to go down

I will drop the floor out

my monsters will be sneaky and devious

and deceitful

I will try to tear you apart

but I will work within the tools of the

game just like the players have to and

this is why if you really do want to

live by being a terror to behold you

cannot have a DM screen

there is nothing more terrifying in this

world than the truth

and to know that that truth is UN is

non-negotiable is is immutable out in

the open when those dice roll that fear

that you fantasize about as a dungeon

master you can feel it in the air

when there's a high damage roll coming

in is a perfect moment and a dungeon

master rolls it out in the open

you know high damage spikes accidental

high damage spikes are probably the most

nerfed thing in the game as far as

what's happening behind the DM screen

right you all know it come on just admit

it

you don't want to kill people on

accident that's not cool but if you're

rolling out in the open oh God the

terror it's it's like peeling back the

veil of the cosmos and looking into the

very workings of the universe

there's no Veil there's no frosting

there's no fog it's the absolute and the

truth is non-negotiable because all of

you see it at the same time it woohoo

so when those 48 roll man there is a

possibility of 32 damage there and that

is a real possibility and it will not be

nerfed

being a terror to behold does not mean

that you are taking pleasure

in the fact that you're the dungeon

master and therefore you have some kind

of leg up as a destructive force now

being a terror to behold means that your

players are afraid of the world they're

afraid of the truth they're afraid of

the results of their own actions they're

not afraid of you as a person

the world the monsters and the story are

what's terrifying and you're creating

that together as the dungeon master

you're just the sort of the moderator

you're just moving the sausage from one

part of the factory to the other

the fact that every once in a while

there's a skull in one of the sausages

now that's terrifying

I don't know what the hell that metaphor

is

but there you have it there's a skull in

the sausage my friends there's a skull

in the sausage

and that is the entirety of the dungeon

Masters oath I hope that it's as

Illuminating and as rejuvenating for you

guys as it is for me I love to every few

weeks just look bad at back at it tell

myself I'm doing those things ask myself

if I'm doing those things renew my

efforts I know that renewing your

efforts is a huge part of this hobby

because sometimes you just cooked out on

it you just don't want to keep going a

few days or weeks pass sometimes it's

even years

then you return you redouble you're

excited again and the oath is useful

again

so I hope it serves that function in

your life as it does in mind this is

hanker Inferno you've been listening to

Rune Hammer this is RPG talks episode

five thanks for tuning in everybody and

uh

strength honor and the dungeon Masters

oath I'll see you guys on the internet

peace out

[Music]


[Music]

hey guys it's anchor inferno here coming

back

at you from runehammer and if you're

ever wondering what i'm doing between

making videos and doing all these other

projects well

i love helping people out on their

projects doing

artwork for rpg projects all over the

world

and this little video real quick is a

shout out to one of those projects

that's very near and dear to my heart

but also

the sort of the tool set that was used

so not only is the project exciting but

the tool sets exciting

so there's just excitement just so much

exciting

the project is you're looking at it

right here this is the mecha hack

it's the second book for the mecca hack

it's called the mission manual

mega hack is a small tight rules set

from

ab tab is what i was about to say

absolute tabletop but you know if you're

cool you just say ab tab

yo ab tab can i borrow your boob box and

then like

word it's a small tight system um

derived from the black hack which is

fantastic little system

and the mission manual is now like a

content expansion so anyways it's a

great little

system cool little book nice tidy layout

tidy kind of look

and i have been lucky enough to be able

to do the artwork for this

cool little set of books and it's all

mecca stuff kind of

inspired by gundam as well as battle

tech all kind of mashed together

but also the guys at apptab were cool

enough to kind of just entrust me with

inventing these

mecca styles and the styles of the

pilots and stuff like that

so that's all fun and their second

kickstarter is running right now you

should go

to this link or maybe there's a link in

the description here down below i

am just learning how to use youtube it's

only been five years

not only is the mecha hack both the

original book and now the mission manual

are just kind of like i love them

but doing the art was really fun and not

just because

it is mecca arc which is very you know

my stuff

like that's my jam right there it's

really fun because

i also got to use this tool right here

this is a remarkable tablet

now some of you guys may have heard um

me talk about this here's the pen

a real like next generation type tool

um a very high tech and a very elegant

drawing tool for those of you out there

who are just like drawing fanatics like

me i spent so much time

every single day drawing that this tool

is brilliant because it is a dedicated

function tool

it's really just for drawing i i know

that you can sort of read

pdfs on here or something i'm told and

make notes on those pdfs but i have no

use for any of that

really there's a couple menus i don't

think i've ever even looked at the menus

on this

there's just your selection menu where

you kind of pick your sketchbooks that

you're working in

and then once you're in working on a

drawing there's a little side menu

which has a couple tools there's a

couple really simple transform tools and

an eraser tool

there's even an undo but i just don't

use those tools the drawing experience

on the remarkable tablet

is so damn good so

it's got a couple foibles um its output

can be

you know maybe not all that you had

dreamed it to be i've got this little

sequence

right here which is like the trick that

i use is that i output pngs from the

remarkable

and then i just run them in through

adobe illustrator

and actually lots of different programs

can do this you just run a trace or a

vectorization

so you make curves out of your pixels

and then you've got infinite resolution

to work with and it actually will

slightly

sort of clean some of your work in a way

that you know might be flattering to you

to your line work if you're sort of

wiggly like i am the remarkable tablet

has been just a blast to use by the way

i'm not sponsored or supported by

remarkable in any way i wish i was

that'd be cool

it's been awesome so doing the artwork

for the mecca hack it was all done on

the remarkable tablet and with

ruth really almost no sort of pencil

work

or undos or clean up in any way shape or

form and that is what i'm so

excited about is just the spirit in

which this art was created so it has

like a lot of

kind of that kind of marker energy that

to me kind of brings back the feeling of

being a kid and like trying to draw tmnt

and kind of doing these wiggly lines

with like a pen or a sharpie and just

sort of learning to

to sort of live with and work with the

craziness of my art

rather than constantly refine it and use

blue pencil work to get better and

better lines and constantly

you know i'm much more always trying to

capture the magical energy

of doing art and just like get the

enthusiasm to come through

and i think the stuff in the mecca hack

kind of does that so

if you're into drawing and you're

looking for a super cool tool

that doesn't show you browsers or let

you you know browse your photos or do

all the things that something like an

ipad or

a surface can do it's an exclusively a

deck

um drawing tool consider getting

yourself one of these remarkables

i absolutely love mine i use it to death

i use it so much it's like

i think i'm just being a little hard on

this i think it got dropped at some

point

but anyways battery life is amazing on

this thing it's just a fantastic tool so

consider that

and also throw a few ducats on this

mecha hack mission manual kickstarter

right here

help out my homies because these are

great tight little books

a lot of you know rules light type

systems may leave you wanting a little

bit but this one

especially for its subject matter which

mecha like gameplay can really get

complex really fast

and to me that kind of can wreck some of

the fun this plays much more like

a dungeon crawler or a sort of an origin

era rpg you know with like simpler

tighter mechanics where you're rolling

dice more often

as the action unfolds so that's it i

just wanted to throw this little quick

one at you guys

always working on my remarkable let me

know if you have one what you think

what kind of next generation tools are

out there that are different that aren't

just smaller computers

computers are great and everything but

having these newer sort of

single-use dedicated devices i think is

a good sign

of where technology might be going as a

lot of us are starting to be driven

crazy by our phones

so yo that's it for right now i'm gonna

try to get back on this whole youtube

jam a little more just like make it

more part of my week and keep an eye out

for some

exciting things coming from rude hammer

here in the next couple weeks

everybody stay safe out there take care

of one another one love

and i will see you guys on the internet

okay peace


hey man yeah you heard about that uh

that cursed videotape man yeah how'd you

get in here it's it's wild so yeah you

uh you watch the tape and uh you watch

this tape and it's like weird stuff like

crazy stuff and then right afterwards

like you know one

two seconds after you watch the date

like

your phone your phone ring your phone

blowing up you answer the phone and

there's like a creepy like a string like

a whispering voice on the other side and

says some weird to you and

that's it that's it you're done

you're done just now man i don't really

buy into all that oh well

i i got a copy right here if you want to

check it out i mean if you want

but oh sure what the hell

uh

[Music]

[Applause]

um

[Music]

uh

okay

[Music]

hello

go forth and craft
